# Session #31 Transformed by Delighting in God’s Beauty

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. THE PURPOSE OF THIS COURSE

A. There are several purposes for this class in 2017. First, to convince you that seeing the beauty of Jesus is not a peripheral subject, but is essential to walking in victory, especially in this hour of history. Second, that this is within reach of every believer (not just a special few). Third, I want to expose the lie that Jesus is boring. He is indescribably fascinating. When John the apostle saw Jesus in Revelation 1, he was overcome with His glory and majesty and fell before Him, overwhelmed.

B. Both the seraphim and the prophet Isaiah were overwhelmed at seeing God’s beauty (Isa. 6:2, 5). The seraphim declared that the whole earth is full of God’s glory or beauty (Isa. 6:3). Creation (including human history) is the canvas on which many aspects of God’s beauty are displayed.

>1…I saw the Lord sitting on a throne…2Above it [the temple] stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 3And one [seraphim] cried to another and said: “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory [beauty]!”…5So I said: “Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips…for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.” (Isa. 6:1-5)

C. My prayer is that God would raise up theologians of the beauty of God—those who seek to behold the beauty of God, asking the Spirit to show them new things about Jesus’ heart and leadership.

## II. DAVID’S DETERMINATION TO SEARCH OUT GOD’S BEAUTY

A. One of King David’s lifelong goals was to intentionally search out God’s beauty (Ps. 27:4).

>4One thing I have desired…all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord. (Ps. 27:4)

B. This verse has been significant to the IHOPKC Missions Base community. Our mission statement is “The IHOPKC community exists to partner in the Great Commission by advancing 24/7 prayer with worship and proclaiming the beauty of Jesus and His glorious return.” My prayer is that desiring to behold and proclaim God’s beauty be part of each one’s mission statement for their life.

C. I was surprised to learn that the one thing that David, the great warrior King of Israel, sought was to behold God’s beauty. I would have thought it would have been to defeat the enemies of God.

D. I see David as a “theologian of God’s beauty.” His resolve to pursue God’s beauty in a primary way was a remarkable advance in the kingdom of God. David was the first to cultivate this new view of the world and this new approach to God. The Spirit will emphasize this in the generation that Jesus returns. David did this over 3,000 years ahead of this time. He was a prophetic down-payment of this for the end-time Church—when God will raise up shepherds like David (Jer. 3:15; Isa.33:17).

E. All the days of my life: We are to be intentional in searching for God’s beauty all of our days. We will never outgrow or exhaust it. The living creatures never outgrow their fascination with it. A billion years from now we will see new things about Jesus that will fascinate our heart.

F. Delight: In Psalm 37, David said something else that was surprising and startling. In the overflow of pursuing God’s beauty, David discovered delight in his relationship with God. No one in the Old Testament emphasized beauty and the pleasure in relating to God or the call to enjoy God. The biblical vision of the Christian life is a lifestyle of enjoying God by delighting in His beauty.

>4Delight yourself in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart. (Ps. 37:4)

G. The good news is that our relationship with God is more than dutiful service with sacrifice. It is interacting with the most beautiful Being imaginable, who longs to reveal His beauty to His people.

H. “I do not want to simply live the Christian life, I want to love living it” (Sam Storms).

I. Paul agreed with David. He gave up everything when empowered by God’s beauty (Phil. 3:8).

>8I also count all things loss for the excellence [beauty] of the knowledge of Christ. (Phil. 3:8)

1. Paul used words such as excellency and glory instead of beauty. We can use those words interchangeably in context of describing God’s majesty and grandeur.

2. Pray: “Let me see what Paul saw about You, and I will be able to respond like Paul responded to You,” or “Spirit, let me see and feel what You see and feel when You look at Jesus.”

J. Paul elaborated on the power of beholding the Lord’s beauty, emphasizing its transforming power. Beholding or seeing God’s beauty changes our emotions. It transforms us from the inside out.

>18We all…beholding…the glory [beauty] of the Lord, are being transformed… (2 Cor. 3:18)

K. The beauty narrative: We embrace the truth about a beautiful God, who has a beautiful plan for our life, in which He uses His power to impart incorruptible beauty into our life that continues forever (Rom. 8:28). David was intentional about focusing on the “beauty narrative” of his life (27:4).

>4One thing I have desired…all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord. (Ps. 27:4)

L. The dark narrative: The enemy wants to establish dark narrative of our life—so we focus on how bad we are treated, how hard things are, what we do not have, how much we fail, and how worthless our life is. We must refuse to let a dark narrative dominate our heart and internal conversation.

## III. JESUS IMPARTS HIS BEAUTY

A. The beauty that Jesus possesses is the very beauty that He imparts to His people. It starts in this age and comes to the fullness in the age to come.

>1The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me…3to give them beauty for ashes. (Isa. 61:1-3)

B. The Lord imparts His beauty into lives that have been burned out on sinful passions, leaving only a “heap of ashes.” We must not neglect this dimension of our salvation.

C. Beholding God’s beauty includes more than seeing His beauty in creation, redemption, and His leadership of history, but it includes the beauty that He imparts to His people.
