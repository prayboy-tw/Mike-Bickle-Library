# Session #24 Seeking God’s Beauty as Hidden Treasure (Prov. 2:1-5)

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. EMPOWERED BY THE SUPERIOR PLEASURE OF DISCOVERING GOD’S BEAUTY

A. David saw God’s personality as full of joy and pleasure. The greatest pleasures available to the human spirit are spiritual pleasures—when God reveals God to our spirit. We are liberated from the inferior pleasures of sin by experiencing the superior pleasures of the beauty of Jesus.

>11In Your presence is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forever. (Ps. 16:11)

>8You give them drink from the river of Your pleasures. (Ps. 36:8)

B. Christianity (and holiness) is a call to the superior pleasures of being fascinated by the revelation of Jesus. There is no aspect of God’s grace that more powerfully transforms our emotions or satisfies us than when the Holy Spirit reveals the beauty of God to our heart. The most transforming, exhilarating, motivating reality in the kingdom is Jesus Himself!

C. God is the author of pleasure. He created us to enjoy physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual pleasures. Our longing for pleasure is part of our created design and must be satisfied; it will not go away. The devil tempts us with “counterfeit” pleasures that are outside of God’s will.

D. The Spirit escorts us on a treasure hunt into the beauty of Jesus. This is divine entertainment.

>13The Spirit of truth…will guide [escort] you into all truth…14He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you. (Jn. 16:13-14)

E. The knowledge of the beauty of God is:  
1. The most powerful and pleasurable reality anyone can experience.  
2. The most costly treasure to pursue, but the most valuable and lasting one.  
3. The most neglected issue in the kingdom—radical pursuit of God is seen as an error to many.  
4. The most attacked truth—Satan attacks the truth about Jesus’s beauty in an unrelenting way.  
5. The most emphasized truth of the Holy Spirit in the generation in which the Lord returns.

## II. FIVE CONDITIONS FOR CULTIVATING THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD (PROV. 2:1-5)

A. In my college years, I was in anguish over my inability to grow in the knowledge of God. The Lord touched me deeply with this passage in my college years (Jan. 2, 1975).

>1If you receive My words, and treasure My commands within you, 2so that you incline your ear to wisdom…3If you cry out for discernment…4If you seek her as silver and…hidden treasures; 5then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God. (Prov. 2:1-5)

B. Condition #1: Spirit of obedience—to receive God’s words (2:1) and set our heart to obey them. God is holy. In being holy, He has the highest, most pleasurable quality of life in existence. Many see holiness as the drudgery of self-denial. Holiness equips us to enjoy life with God. Loving Jesus including loving Him with a spirit of obedience (Jn. 14:15).

>1If you will receive My words... (Prov. 2:1)

C. Condition #2: Meditation on God’s Word—to treasure God’s commands or Word (2:1). We treasure God’s Word by prioritizing time to “pray-read” His Word. We dialogue with Him as we read the Scriptures. Scripture gives us the “conversational material” for our prayer life.

>1If you will...treasure My commands [Word] within you... (Prov. 2:1)

>39You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which 40But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.
testify of Me. (Jn. 5:39-40)

D. Condition #3: A teachable spirit—to incline our ear to wisdom (2:2). This speaks of inclining our heart to truly receive what the Word says instead of “twisting” its meaning to support compromise or unbelief in our life or to continue in various biases we learned in our early days.

>2If you…incline your ear to wisdom, and apply your heart to understanding… (Prov. 2:2)

E. Condition #4: Pray for more revelation of God—to cry out for understanding (2:3).

>3Yes, if you cry out for discernment and lift up your voice for understanding… (Prov. 2:3)

>7Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 8For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds… (Mt. 7:7-8)

>17…that the…Father of glory may give…revelation in the knowledge of Him… (Eph. 1:17)

F. Condition #5: Seek diligently—search for insight into God’s beauty as hidden treasure (2:4). The Spirit gives more to those who invest more time in seeking God’s beauty. There is some correlation between the time that we seek God and the measure of understanding that we receive.

>4If you seek her as silver and search for her as for hidden treasures... (Prov. 2:4)

1. A kingly spirit searches diligently and refuses to be denied.

>2It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, but the glory of kings is to search out a matter. (Prov. 25:2)

2. Our life is a treasure hunt into the knowledge of God, which becomes our very gold.

>24You will lay your gold in the dust…25Yes, the Almighty will be your gold… (Job 22:24-25)

G. God’s promise: We will understand the fear of God and the knowledge of God (2:5). We will grow in the knowledge and fear of God which includes living with a sense of marvel and awe.

>5Then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. (Prov. 2:5)

H. God releases small “measures” of insight and inspiration from the Word which tenderize our spirit for a few moments. These subtle “flashes” of glory are to be a regular part of our relationship with God. Over time, this holy pleasurable influence changes us emotionally.
