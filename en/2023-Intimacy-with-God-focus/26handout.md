# Session #26 Encountering God’s Beauty in Times of Betrayal (Pt. 2)

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. THE END-TIME CHURCH IS TRANSFORMED IN CONTEXT TO BETRAYAL

A. The combination of an unprecedented outpouring of the Spirit with betrayal is part of the optimum environment for the Church to be transformed in order to relate as an unified international family of affection (Jn. 17:22-23). Multitudes in the end-time Church will be progressing toward mature love, while many will be overcome with offense that will lead them to betray other believers (Mt. 24:10).

>22“And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one: 23…that the world may know that You have sent Me…” (Jn. 17:22-23)

>10“And then many will be offended, will betray one another...12the love of many will grow cold… 14This gospel…will be preached in all the world…then the end will come.” (Mt. 24:10-14)

>16“You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends…” (Lk. 21:16)

B. We must be alerted to the two extreme social and spiritual developments occurring simultaneously in the global body of Christ in the end times. They are total opposites—a culture of betrayal with an increasing hardness of heart (Mt. 24:10) in contrast to a culture of deep love and unity (Jn. 17:23).

C. Betrayal creates urgency for intimacy with God—that is to go much deeper in our relationship with God to find understanding, reconciliation, healing, and peace for the pain that is caused by betrayal.

D. Betrayal is an “accelerant” that leads to faster growth in humble love or in bitterness and offense.

E. The gospel is made known to all nations (Mt. 24:14; Jn. 17:23) in context to betrayal and pressure.

F. By definition, betrayal is in context to a close relationship—including family and friends.

G. Betrayal is both a demonic attack to hinder our spiritual growth and a divine gift to enhance it. God granted and appointed that His people endure being persecuted and betrayed (Phil. 1:29; 1 Thes. 3:3) that they may be transformed by it—leading to great benefit to them in this age and the age to come.

>29For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ…to suffer for His sake… (Phil. 1:29)

H. Those relating in godly ways contend for the destiny, honor, and family blessings of others. Hundreds of millions will respond to betrayal in a godly way resulting in the supernatural end-time unity of the Church. What Satan means for evil, the Lord uses for good (Gen. 50:20)

>44I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you… 45that you may be sons of your Father…for He makes His sun rise on the evil… (Mt. 5:44-45)

## II. THE SPIRIT REVEALS MORE ABOUT JESUS TO US IN CONTEXT TO BEING BETRAYED

A. Jesus wanted them to know that some would be betrayed in being put out of their spiritual families (synagogues; 16:2). All the apostles were cast out of their synagogues, killed, or imprisoned.

>19…the world hates you… 20If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. (Jn. 15:19-20)

>26When the Helper [the Spirit] comes…He will testify of Me [reveal more of Me]. 27And you will bear witness… 16:1These things I have spoken to you, that you should not be made to stumble [be overcome by offense]. 2They will put you out of the synagogues…[and] kill you…” (Jn. 15:26-16:2)

B. He will testify of Me (15:26): In the context of persecution, the Spirit will teach God’s people to understand and align themselves more to Jesus’ heart, leadership, and eternal values—so they grow in love for God and people by growing in purity, humility, mercy, generosity, and gratitude.

C. You will bear witness: The Spirit escorts us on a treasure hunt into the beauty of Jesus. This is divine entertainment. There is no aspect of God’s grace that more powerfully transforms our emotions or satisfies us than when the Holy Spirit reveals the beauty of God to our heart. The most transforming, exhilarating, motivating reality in the kingdom is Jesus Himself!

>13The Spirit of truth…will guide [escort] you into all truth…14He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you. (Jn. 16:13-14)

D. The knowledge of the beauty of God is:  
1. The most powerful and pleasurable reality anyone can experience.  
2. The most costly treasure to pursue, but the most valuable and lasting one.  
3. The most neglected issue in the kingdom—radical pursuit of God is seen as an error to many.  
4. The most attacked truth—Satan attacks the truth about Jesus’s beauty in an unrelenting way.  
5. The most emphasized truth of the Holy Spirit in the generation in which the Lord returns.

E. God releases small “measures” of insight and inspiration from the Word which tenderize our spirit for a few moments. These subtle “flashes” of glory are to be a regular part of our relationship with God. Over time, this holy pleasurable influence changes us emotionally.

F. The promise of the seal of divine love in Song 8:6 includes the Lord giving the worldwide body of Christ grace to love even the offended ones who betray us—“love as strong as death”(Song 8:6). Specifically, this love is love for the Bridegroom King who loves us and those who betray us. The “oil of intimacy” is cultivated best in the fires of persecution including being betrayed.

>6Set Me as a seal upon your heart…for love is as strong as death… (Song 8:6)

G. Paul rejoiced in the opportunity to magnify how attractive Jesus is to an unbelieving world by loving and trusting His leadership while being persecuted. Believers who faithfully love Jesus even when persecuted or betrayed are a “living portrait,” giving a public display of how glorious Jesus is to them. They give an incarnational witness to His beauty, majesty, and excellent leadership.

>24I rejoice in my sufferings…and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ… (Col. 1:24)
