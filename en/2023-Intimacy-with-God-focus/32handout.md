# Session #32 Practical Ways to Experience God’s Beauty

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. DAVID’S LIFELONG GOALS TO SEARCH OUT GOD’S BEAUTY (PS. 27:4).

A. The beauty narrative: We embrace the truth about a beautiful God, who has a beautiful plan for our life, in which He uses His power to impart incorruptible beauty into our life that continues forever (Rom. 8:28). David was intentional about focusing on the “beauty narrative” of his life (27:4).

>4One thing I have desired…all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord. (Ps. 27:4)

B. The dark narrative: The enemy wants to establish dark narrative of our life—so we focus on how bad we are treated, how hard things are, what we do not have, how much we fail, and how worthless our life is. We must refuse to let a dark narrative dominate our heart and internal conversation.

## II. JESUS IMPARTS HIS BEAUTY

A. The beauty that Jesus possesses is the very beauty that He imparts to His people. It starts in this age and comes to the fullness in the age to come.

>1The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me…3to give them beauty for ashes. (Isa. 61:1-3)

1. The Lord imparts His beauty into lives that have been burned out on sinful passions, leaving only a “heap of ashes.” We must not neglect this dimension of our salvation.

2. Beholding God’s beauty includes more than seeing His beauty in creation, redemption, and His leadership of history, but it includes the beauty that He imparts to His people.

B. Imparted beauty: Our choices for love and godly character are aspects of His beauty imparted in us. We embrace what the Word says about how God sees beauty in us—in a gentle and quiet spirit.

>4…let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God. (1 Pet. 3:4)

1. Hidden beauty: Peter provided significant insight when he taught on the hidden person of the heart. God sees incorruptible beauty in His people. We do not see it, but God sees it. We only know that God esteems humility as beautiful because the Scripture says He does.

2. Very precious: The beauty of humility is very dear to God. Jesus sees our lives so differently from us. Many believers see their life mostly as weak, broken, irrelevant, and a failure.

3. Incorruptible: God sees humility as incorruptible beauty, or beauty that will never diminish. It will last throughout the age to come. There is continuity with this life in the age to come.

4. Gentle spirit: Some translate this as a humble, or meek, spirit.

5. Quiet spirit: Having a quiet spirit speaks of trusting the Lord’s leadership in our life, especially in times of difficulty, rather than being fearful.

C. The beauty of our life is “hidden” in Christ—it will be fully manifested when Jesus returns. The challenge with the beauty that God imparts to us is that it is hidden from our five senses, but the Word says it there. If the Word says it, then that must be our confession, or testimony.

>3…your life is hidden with Christ in God. 4When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear [the hidden glory of God in you will be seen] with Him in glory [beauty]. (Col. 3:3-4)

## III. SEARCHING OUT GOD’S BEAUTY: AN OVERVIEW

A. Overview: We are to be intentional in searching out God’s beauty as set forth in what the Scripture says about His Person and His heavenly court and in expressions of it in His creation, redemption, and leadership in directing history, inspiring godliness, and imparting abilities to people.

B. God’s beauty is expressed in His person and His heavenly court in how He looks, thinks, and feels. The appearance of Jesus’ resurrected body and court are beautiful beyond description (Rev. 1; 4). Jesus has the ultimate beautiful mind; He delights in relating to His people and showing mercy.

C. God’s beauty is expressed in what He did and does in:

1. His creation of the world—including humans, animals, plants, the earth, the seas, and the heavens (billions of galaxies) plus sights (colors, brilliance), sounds (music, melodies, harmonies), and fragrances. All the beauty that we see in this world is a dim reflection of the source of ultimate beauty—God.

2. His redemption—including Jesus’ incarnation, ministry, death, and resurrection, etc.

3. His leadership—in directing history, inspiring godliness, and imparting abilities to people.

a. How He directs history—including the nations (individually and collectively), His end-time plans, our lives, and the lives of others by causing all things to work together for good for those who love Him (Rom. 8:28).

b. How He inspires godliness—including heroic virtue in people who act courageously with sacrificial love. He inspires noble character—there are many stories of courage, generosity, compassion that have been captured in biographies, novels, movies, etc.

c. How He imparts gifts and abilities and increased knowledge to bring one's abilities to fullness in many areas including medicine, social sciences, technology, architecture, media, doctors, engineers, scientists, inventors, educators, athletes, writers, artists, singers, musicians, composers, artisans, movie producers, chefs, and many more.

>10We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works… (Eph. 2:10)

D. We are to search diligently for the knowledge of God’s beauty as for hidden silver. There are hints, whispers, and evidence of it in many places. David intentionally searched for God’s beauty all his days—in God’s creation, redemption, leadership, and the way He inspires people to act.

>4If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures; 5then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God [God’s beauty]. (Prov. 2:4-5)
