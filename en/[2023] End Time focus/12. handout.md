# Session #12 The Abomination of Desolation

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. JESUS CALLED US TO SEE THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION

A. Jesus called His people “to see” the abomination of desolation and then pointed us to the book of Daniel to gain understanding of it (Mt. 24:15). Paul and John elaborated on it (2 Thes. 2; Rev. 13). The abomination of desolation is the first event in the Bible that signals the start of the tribulation.

>15“Therefore when you see the ‘abomination of desolation,’ spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place” (whoever reads, let him understand), 16“then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains…21then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been…” (Mt. 24:15-16, 21)

B. Daniel’s “abomination of desolation” is the central event that helps us to understand Jesus’ view of the end times. This is the only specific political and religious event that Jesus identified which will let His people know that they are in the generation of His return and that the Great Tribulation has started. The fact of this event will help them understand other key events that are implied by it.

C. Two main components of the abomination of desolation will be the image of the Beast and the mark of the Beast. Thus, there are many implications associated with the abomination. For example, in order for the Antichrist to put an image of himself in the temple in Jerusalem, Israel must first be a nation with Jerusalem under its jurisdiction, and the temple must be built on its original site (the very place of Solomon’s temple), functioning with sacrifices according to the law of Moses.

D. The abomination of desolation is referred to eight times in the Bible. Daniel used a form of this phrase four times (8:13; 9:27; 11:31; 12:11), two passages quote Jesus’ use of it (Mt. 24:15; Mk. 13:14), and both Paul (2 Thes. 2:3-4) and John (Rev. 13:12-18) described it. We understand it best by comparing Daniel’s four references to it with what Jesus, Paul, and John said about it.

## II. WHAT IS THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION? A QUICK OVERVIEW

A. The abomination of desolation refers to specific deeds being done that are abominable to God. These deeds lead to the desolation (destruction) of many people and nations. In other words, it speaks of abominations (evil deeds) that lead to the desolation (destruction) of the nations, etc.

B. The main event emphasized in the New Testament is the setting up the abomination of desolation, i.e. the Antichrist placing his image in the temple (2 Thes. 2:3-4; Rev. 13:12-18). The main event emphasized in the Old Testament is the stopping of the sacrifices (Dan. 8:13; 9:27; 11:31; 12:11).

C. This abomination to God will occur in two ways—each involving several different dynamics.

1. The demands of the Antichrist: The Antichrist will demand that he be worshiped as God after he sits in the holy place in the temple in Jerusalem and stops the daily sacrifices. He will force others to accept this under the threat of death.

2. The responses of the people: Hundreds of millions of people will accept his claims.

D. The desolation will occur in two ways—both are related to worshiping the Antichrist.

1. Antichrist will cause desolation: He will seek to destroy any who refuse to worship him. He will bring desolation to the people, cities, and nations who refuse to worship him.

2. God will cause desolation: God will destroy any who agree to worship the Antichrist. He will bring judgment on the people, cities, and nations that worship the Antichrist.

>9If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark… 10he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength… (Rev. 14:9-10)

## III. THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION: A CLOSER LOOK

A. John described the abomination of desolation in Revelation 13. Two main components of the abomination of desolation will be the image of the Beast and the mark of the Beast.

>15He [False Prophet] was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. 16He causes all…to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, 17and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark… (Rev. 13:15-18)

1. Image of the Beast: An image of the Antichrist will be placed in the holy place of the rebuilt temple in Jerusalem. This image will be the greatest abomination in history deceiving many into worshiping the Antichrist. The image is one of the most emphasized end-time events. John emphasized it ten times (Rev. 13:14, 15 [3x]; 14:9, 11; 15:2; 16:2; 19:20; 20:4). The image may combine cutting-edge technology (holograms?) and supernatural demonic elements, causing this image to breathe and speak. There may be a global network of statues (holograms?) in local “worship sanctuaries” connected to the temple.

2. Mark of the Beast: The mark will be a part of the abomination of desolation (Rev. 13:16-17). It will be illegal to refuse the mark; those refusing it will not be allowed to buy or sell and will be seen as dangerous criminals of the state, guilty of death. I believe it will involve more than receiving something like an embedded chip, but also covenanting to worship the Antichrist.

B. Paul described the abomination of desolation in 2 Thessalonians 2.

>3Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day [Jesus’ return] will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin [Antichrist] is revealed, the son of perdition, 4who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God [associated with God] or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God... 9The coming of the lawless one [Antichrist] is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders… (2 Thes. 2:3-9)

C. Neither Paul nor John use Daniel’s phrase the “abomination of desolation” but it is clear that they are referring to it since Paul prophesied that a man will sit in the temple declaring Himself to be God and confirming his claim with miracles (2 Thes. 2:4; Rev. 13:13-14). The implication is that he will seek to be worshiped as God since the purpose of the temple is to worship God. John described Antichrist being worship by people from all nations. He prophesied that an image of a man—the Antichrist—will be made and the nations will be forced by law to worship it (Rev. 13:4, 14-17).

D. Summary: The great abomination will include the Antichrist claiming to be God and forcing the nations, by state law and with state resources, to worship him as God, under the penalty of death. This will be the greatest abomination to God in history, yet it will be the Church’s greatest hour.
