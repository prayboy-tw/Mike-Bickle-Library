# Session #17 Refuse To Be Intimidated by the Error of Replacement Theology

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. INTRODUCTION

A. I believe history will change in context to the Isaiah 62 Fast—well over 5 million committed to pray for Israel for 1 hour a day for 21 days (May 7-28), and 12,000 ministry hubs from 120 nations committed to mobilize people to pray for Israel. The info was translated in over 100 languages. I am guessing that 15 million+ believers are in a new conversation about the biblical narrative of Israel.

1. I want you aware that something historic is unfolding so that it creates urgency in you to prepare yourself to help others to understand the biblical narrative of Israel. I am guessing that in the next 3 years the 15 million will draw 3-4 friends into this biblical conversation resulting in maybe 50 million being engaged. Because these 50 million love Jesus and the Bible, they will quickly see the biblical narrative of Israel, so this will lead to 100 million intercessors for Israel in the years to come. The historic arrogance and intimidation that has left millions in the Church in ignorance or deception will be totally reversed before Jesus returns.

2. I am speaking to pastors or to those who host Bible studies in person or via social media

B. May 2023 was a catalytic time in the escalation of the global conversation of the biblical narrative of Israel in the body of Christ. Replacement theology was given a “head wound” like the stone that knocked out Goliath so that David might cut off his head. In May 2023, God “guided a stone” to wound “the Goliath of replacement theology” (1 Sam. 17:49). I assure you, after 1700 years, the error of replacement theology will be cleansed from global end-time Church before Jesus returns.

>49…the stone sank into his [Goliath’s] forehead, and he fell…there was no sword in the hand of David…51he ran and stood over the Philistine, took his [Goliath’s] sword…and cut off his head. (1 Sam. 17:49-51)

C. One emphasis in this message is that God’s servants should no longer be intimidated by this error that will lead some to deny their faith in the end times (Rom. 11:22). There is no sound biblical basis for this popular, false idea. God’s people are counting on their leaders to tell them the truth.

1. Based on internet data, I am guessing about 700,000 people enrolled in a theological seminary in North America over the 50 last years. In this context, many future pastors were taught the error of replacement theology by gifted professors—so they assumed it was a biblical truth. I want to speak kindly against this error that some prominent scholarly seminary professors have promoted, but I want to speak clearly enough to stir pastor to resist being intimidated by their former professors and to begin to study the biblical narrative of Israel and to speak on it.

2. When I consider how such a dangerous false teaching was so dominant for nearly 1,700 years without any sound biblical basis, resulting in over 90% of 2 billion professing Christians unprepared to stand for Israel even as we approach the time when God has called Gentiles to provoke Israel to jealousy, I am struck by how zealously Satan worked to perpetuate this deception for this time when the Church must be prepared to stand as messengers of His love and salvation to unbelieving Israel in the face of precedented anti-Semitism in the end times.

3. Over one billion believers are counting on their pastors to tell them the truth about Israel.

## II. REPLACEMENT THEOLOGY: A SIMPLE OVERVIEW

A. Replacement theology promotes the error that God is finished with Israel as a nation and the promises He made to ancient Israel in the Old Testament have been given to the Church. Thus, the Church is God’s “new true Israel” who inherits all the national promises He initially gave to Israel. Replacement theology historically has also been called supersessionism or fulfillment theology.

B. Replacement theology spiritualized rather than interpreted the prophetic promises given to Israel in a literal, plain sense way. It embraces a non-literal, allegorical interpretation of these promises and/or insists that most of the end-time prophecies about Israel have been fulfilled in history.

C. Replacement theology views the Church as “spiritual Israel” and/or “spiritual Jerusalem.” In the NT, the term, Israel, is used nearly 70 times, always referring to the physical people of Israel, never as a substitute term for the Church. The phrases, New Israel and Spiritual Israel, are not in the Bible.

1. Not even one Bible verse clearly declares that the Church is now spiritual Israel.

2. In my first 7 years of pastoring (1976-1983), I assumed there were many Bible verses that proved that the Church was spiritual Israel. It was in June 1983 that I was challenged by messianic leaders to support my replacement theology views but I could not find one verse.

D. Replacement theology has been taught by the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant churches for the majority of their history. Many Church Fathers—including Justin Martyr (AD 100-165), Augustine of Hippo (354-430), John Calvin, Martin Luther and more, espoused this doctrine.

E. There are 2 main approaches to replacement theology.

1. Israel’s place as the people of God was forfeited. The Church replaced Israel due to God’s permanent judgment on Israel for killing Jesus, saying Israel is disqualified forever. This view is just another expression of the abolitionist view of the Abrahamic Covenant.

2. Israel’s role as God’s people was completed. This view says that after Jesus came, Israel’s mission was completed. The Church replaced Israel. God is no longer working through Israel. This is an expression of the reconstructionist view of the Abrahamic Covenant.

F. Literal interpretation: The best Bible teachers in history embrace the historical-grammatical method of interpretation. This interpretative gird seeks to understand each passage according to the original meaning that was intended by the one who wrote it. Literal interpretation seeks to understand the “plain meaning”—what the author intended as conveyed by its grammatical construction and historical context, including the cultural background of the author and its readers.

G. Replacement theology is one of the most dangerous errors promoted throughout history by many who are reputed to be trustworthy Bible scholars for many centuries. There is serious contradiction in their teaching—in that they consistently insist on the literal interpretation of Scripture except when it relates to Israel. In my opinion, it seems to be an blatant contradiction that is a serious blemish on their legacy of being honest scholars who are faithful witnesses of the truth.

H. Replacement theology is a dangerous demonic strategy that fueled anti-Semitism in the Church and emboldened Christians to persecute Jews, resulting in Jews being deeply offended at Christians.
