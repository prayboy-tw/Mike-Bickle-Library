# Session #25 Seven Situations in Israel During the Tribulation (Pt. 1)

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. ISRAEL REFINED: 7 SITUATIONS FOR JEWS IN THE LAND IN THE 3½ YEARS

A. The Lord will bring 1/3 of Israel through the fire to refine them in bringing them to salvation. It is possible that over 5-6 million Jews worldwide will look to Jesus for salvation in the end times.

>9I will bring the one-third through the fire, will refine them…and test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name…and each one will say, “The LORD is my God.” (Zech. 13:9)

>26And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written… (Rom. 11:26)

B. The time of intense difficulty for Israel in the end times will not last longer than 42 months (Dan. 12:1, 7; Mt. 24:21-22; cf. Dan. 7:25; 9:27; 12:7; Rev. 11:2-3; 12:6, 14; 13:5).

>1“At that time Michael shall stand up…there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation…at that time your people shall be delivered… 7I heard the man [angel]… he swore by Him …it shall be for a time, times, and half a time [42 months]; and when the power of the holy people has been completely shattered, all these things shall be finished. (Dan. 12:1, 7)

>15“…when you see the ‘abomination of desolation,’ spoken of by Daniel…16then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains… 21For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been… 22Unless those days were shortened [42 months], no flesh would be saved.” (Mt. 24:15-22)

C. A time of great trouble will come to Israel immediately after they enjoy a time of peace, safety, and prosperity (1 Thes. 5:2-3; cf. Isa. 2:7; Ezek. 38:8, 14, 16; Joel 2:3).

>2…the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. 3For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them…and they shall not escape. (1 Thes. 5:2-3)

>8“In the latter years you will…[be] gathered on the mountains of Israel…all of them dwell safely… 11and you [Antichrist] will…go up against a land of unwalled villages…to a peaceful people, who dwell safely… 14On that day when My people Israel dwell safely…” (Ezek. 38:8-14)

D. I identify 7 situations for Jewish people living in Israel during the Tribulation (for 3½ years):

1. Some will remain in the land—protected by God (Isa. 4:3; Zech. 12:6-14; 14:2; Rev. 7:4).

2. Some will be anointed for ministry (Joel 2:28; Mic. 7:15; Rev. 11:3; 16:6; 18:24).

3. Some will be empowered for battle in military conflict (Is. 41:15 Zech. 9:13; 10:3-7; 12:6-8).

4. Some will flee into the wilderness of the nations (Ezek. 20:35; Mt. 24:16; Rev. 12:14).

5. Some will rebel against God (Ezek. 20:38; 34:16-22).

6. Some will be killed by the Antichrist’s forces (Dan. 7:21; 25; Zech. 11:16; 13:8; Rev. 13:7).

7. Some will be taken captive—Half of those in Jerusalem will be taken captive (Zech. 14:2).

>2I will gather all the nations…against Jerusalem…half of the city shall go into captivity,… (Zech. 14:2)

## II. #1 SOME WILL REMAIN IN THE LAND—PROTECTED BY GOD

A. Some who remain in the land and those in the nations will be supernaturally protected (Isa. 4:3; 43:2; Zech. 14:2; Rev. 7:4; 12:14-16; cf. Ezek. 9:4-6; 28:25-26 were partially fulfilled).

>2I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem…half of the city shall go into captivity, but the remnant of the people shall not be cut off from the city. (Zech. 14:2)

>3It shall come to pass that he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy—everyone who is recorded among the living in Jerusalem. (Isa. 4:3)

>4And I heard the number of those who were sealed. One hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel were sealed… (Rev. 7:4)

>4…the LORD said to him [an angel], “Go through…the midst of Jerusalem [586 BC], and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it.” 5To the others [angels] He said…, “Go after him through the city and kill [via the army of Babylon]; do not let your eye spare, nor have any pity. 6Utterly slay old and young men, maidens and little children…but do not come near anyone on whom is the mark…” (Ezek. 9:4-6)

>14But the woman [remnant of Israel]…[went] into the wilderness…where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time [42 months], from the presence of the serpent… (Rev. 12:14)

>2“I will be with you…when you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned…” (Isa. 43:2)

## III. #2 SOME WILL BE ANOINTED FOR MINISTRY

A. Some Jewish people will be anointed for prophetic ministry (Isa. 59:20-21; Joel 2:28; Mic. 7:15; Rev. 11:3; 16:6; 18:24). There will be a strong prophetic movement in Jerusalem.

>3“And I will give power to my two witnesses [in Jerusalem], and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days [1,260 days or 42 months], clothed in sackcloth.” (Rev. 11:3)

>1“Blow the trumpet in Zion [Jerusalem]…the day of the LORD is coming…15Blow the trumpet in Zion, consecrate a fast…” 18Then the LORD will be zealous for His land… 27“Then you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel… 28I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; your [Jerusalem] sons and daughters shall prophesy… 32In Jerusalem there shall be deliverance… (Joel 2:1-32)

>20“The Redeemer will come to Zion [Jerusalem]… 21This is My covenant with them [Israel]: My Spirit who is upon you…from this time and forevermore.” (Isa. 59:20-21)

## IV. #3 SOME WILL BE EMPOWERED FOR BATTLE IN MILITARY CONFLICT

A. Some will be empowered for battle in military conflict especially at the end of the Tribulation (Isa. 11:14; 41:15; Obad. 18; Mic. 4:13; 5:8-9; Zech. 9:13, 15; 10:3-7; 12:6-8; 14:14).

>4“In that day…I will open My eyes on…Judah, and will strike every horse…with blindness… 6I will make the governors of Judah like a firepan…they shall devour all the surrounding peoples… 8The one who is feeble among them…shall be like David…” (Zech. 12:4-8)

>5They [Judah] shall be like mighty men, who tread down their enemies… (Zech. 10:5)

B. The Lord will make Israel into a mighty threshing sledge that will thresh mountains, speaking of destroying the Antichrist armies (Isa. 41:15). The “you” that God will make into a “threshing sledge” speaks of empowering the Israeli military to resist the Antichrist before Jesus returns. This occurs at the time of Israel’s national salvation—when they all rejoice in the Lord (Isa. 41:16).

>12“Those who war against you shall be as nothing…14Fear not, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel! I will help you…15Behold, I will make you into a new threshing sledge with sharp teeth; you shall thresh the mountains and…make the hills like chaff. 16You shall winnow them, the wind shall carry them away…you shall rejoice in the LORD, and glory in the Holy One of Israel.” (Isa. 41:12-16)
