# Session #2 The Life That God Calls Great: Loving Jesus

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. JOHN 13-17 IS THE GREATEST TEACHING

A. Jesus spoke of some called “great” and some called “least” in the kingdom. God will call their life choices “great” because they loved and obeyed Him. This greatness is attained without regard for outward achievements and impact. It is based on the size of one’s heart response to the Lord.

>19Whoever breaks [consistently] one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so,
shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does [consistently] and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. (Mt. 5:19)

>41…one star differs from another star in glory. 42So also is the resurrection… (1 Cor. 15:41-42)

B. John 13-17 is the greatest teaching given by the greatest teacher! It was given at the Last Supper. Jesus spoke this to the leadership of His new Church to prepare them to walk in a way that God calls “great” and to thrive spiritually even in the face of intense pressures and temptations.

C. Two days earlier on Tuesday, Jesus defined loving God as the “first” and “great” commandment (Mt. 22:38), thus identifying it as the Spirit’s first priority in the kingdom, the “first” calling for our life, the promise we pray for “most,” and the most reliable definition of a “great” life.

>37You shall love the LORD… 38This is the first and great commandment. (Mt. 22:37-38)

D. Jesus’ last prophetic declaration over Israel was, “You shall love the Lord” (Mt. 22:37). Moses prophesied Israel would love God with all their heart in the end times (Deut. 30:1-6).

>6The Lord…will circumcise your heart…to love the Lord…with all your heart. (Deut. 30:6)

## II. JESUS URGED THEM TO ASK FOR ANYTHING IN GOD'S WILL

A. Jesus connected His promise to answer prayer in 14:14 to the Spirit empowering them to love Him in 14:15-16. It takes the power of God to love God with all our heart. The Spirit’s greatest work is to empower people to love Jesus. God is glorified most as people walk in obedient love for Jesus.

>14If you ask anything in My name, I will do it. 15If you love Me, keep My commandments… 16the Father…will give you another Helper… 17the Spirit of truth… (Jn. 14:14-17)

B. When Jesus said to “ask anything” (14:14), He immediately focused them on the grace to love Him (14:15). The ultimate “anything” we can ask for is the grace to walk out the first commandment. We are to pray with faith for the Spirit to “impart the Father’s love for Jesus in our heart” (17:26).

>26“…that the love with which You [the Father] loved Me may be in them…” (Jn. 17:26)

C. Two days earlier on Tuesday, Jesus emphasized this glorious promise to ask for “whatever” (Mk. 11:24)—this is similar to what He said to Solomon (2 Chr. 1:7-12).

>24…whatever things you ask…believe that you receive them, and you will have them. (Mk. 11:24)

>7…God appeared to Solomon [in a dream] and said to him, “Ask! What shall I give you?”… 10“Give me wisdom and knowledge…” 11God said to Solomon: “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches…or honor…nor…long life…12[Therefore] wisdom and knowledge are granted to you; and I will give you riches, wealth and honor…” (2 Chr. 1:7-12)
