# Session #29—David: A Model for Pleasing God When Betrayed

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. REVIEW: THE END-TIME CHURCH IS TRANSFORMED IN CONTEXT TO BETRAYAL

A. The combination of an unprecedented outpouring of the Spirit with betrayal is part of the optimum environment for the Church to be transformed in order to relate as an unified international family of affection (Jn. 17:22-23). Multitudes in the end-time Church will be progressing toward mature love, while many will be overcome with offense that will lead them to betray other believers (Mt. 24:10).

>22“And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one: 23…that the world may know that You have sent Me…” (Jn. 17:22-23)

>10“And then many will be offended, will betray one another...12the love of many will grow cold… 14This gospel…will be preached in all the world…then the end will come.” (Mt. 24:10-14)

>16“You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends…” (Lk. 21:16)

B. Betrayal creates greater urgency in us to go much deeper in our relationship with God in our desire to find understanding, reconciliation, healing, and peace for the pain that is caused by betrayal. What Satan means for evil, the Lord uses for good (Gen. 50:20)

C. Betrayal is an “accelerant” that leads to faster growth in humble love or in bitterness and offense.

## II. DAVID IS A MODEL OF HOW TO RESPOND TO GOD WHEN BETRAYED

A. Through the life of David, scripture gives far more info about how to respond to God when betrayed by those in close relationship than it gives through any other. He is a witness or model (Isa. 55:4) of how to respond to God so as to be equipped to a be leader “after God’s heart” (Acts 13:22).

>4I have given him [David] as a witness [model] to the people, a leader… (Isa. 55:4)

>22“…He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He gave testimony and said, ‘I have found David…a man after My own heart, who will do all My will.’” (Acts 13:22)

>9The eyes of the LORD run to and fro…[to find] those whose heart is loyal to Him.” (2 Chr. 16:9)

>15I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who will feed you with knowledge… (Jer. 3:15)

B. Over a 50-year period, David was betrayed by family members (Saul, Ammon, Absalom, Michal, Adonijah, Joab, Ish-bosheth, his own brothers; Ps. 69:7-12), by his own men (Ziklag; 1 Sam. 30), by top political (Ahithophel) and military leaders (Abner; 2 Sam. 3:9), by his countrymen (Ziphites and at Keilah), the army of Israel (with Saul, then Absalom), and others (Shimei, Doeg, etc.).

C. God trained him in the “seminary of the Spirit” using a jealous king and others who betrayed him. David was betrayed many times yet showed kindness because he looked to God to vindicate him in His own way and timing. He invoked God’s intervention saying, “let God decide” (1 Sam. 24:15), knowing that in God’s timing, he would be vindicated without David taking matters into his hands.

>15“Let the LORD be judge, and [decide; NAS] between you [King Saul] and me…” (1 Sam. 24:15)

## III. KEY EXAMPLES FROM THE LIFE OF DAVID

A. David is a premier example of how to respond to when mistreated. Here, I share my three “go to verses” when I am betrayed or mistreated (1 Sam. 24:12-15; 26:23-24; Ps. 31:5, 15). I found inspiration from David—he is a premier example of how to respond to God when one is betrayed

B. David found Saul sleeping in a cave in wilderness of En Gedi and refused to harm Saul and even stopped his men from harming Saul (1 Sam. 24:6-7).

>4The men of David said, “This is the day…[God] will deliver your enemy into your hand…’” 7David restrained his servants…and did not allow them to rise against Saul. (1 Sam. 24:4-7)

C. David committed or entrusted his cause into God’s hands (1 Sam. 24:12, 15).

>8David arose afterward…called out to Saul, saying…10“This day…the LORD delivered you today into my hand… 12 Let the LORD judge between you and me, and let the LORD avenge me on you. But my hand shall not be against you…15Let the LORD be judge, and judge between you and me, and see and plead my case, and deliver me out of your hand.” (1 Sam. 24:8-15)

D. Several years after David spared Saul in 1 Samuel 24, he continued to seek to kill David—pursuing him with 3,000 soldiers. David again found Saul sleeping in the wilderness of Ziph (1 Sam. 26)

>2Saul…went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David…7There Saul lay sleeping within the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head…8Abishai said to David, “God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day. Now therefore, please, let me strike him at once with the spear.” (1 Sam. 26:2-8)

E. David refused to harm Saul. God caused a deep sleep to come on Saul to test David’s heart.

>9David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against the LORD’s anointed, and be guiltless?” 10David said, “…the LORD shall strike him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go out to battle and perish”…12They got away…for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen on them [Saul’s camp]. (1 Sam. 26:9-12)

F. David committed his cause to God’s hands (1 Sam. 26:24). The Lord removed Saul (1 Chr. 10:14).

>13David…stood on the top of a hill afar off…18He said, “Why does my lord [Saul] thus pursue his servant?...23May the LORD repay every man…for the LORD delivered you into my hand today, but I would not stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed…24…let my life be valued much in the eyes of the LORD, and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation.” (1 Sam. 26:13-24)

G. When we commit ourselves into God’s hands in times of mistreatment, we make a transaction with God to trust Him to intervene and establish His will in our lives, in His way and in His timing. By trusting God to intervene in our conflicts, and by refusing to retaliate and committing to do good to our enemies, we bring God and His activity into the situation.

>19Do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath… 20if your enemy is hungry, feed him … 21Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. (Rom. 12:19-21)

>44I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you… 45that you may be sons of your Father…for He makes His sun rise on the evil… (Mt. 5:44-45)
