# Session #8 Bearing Fruit that Glorifies the Father (Jn. 15:8)

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. WE ARE CHOSEN TO BEAR FRUIT THAT GLORIFIES GOD (JN 15:8)

A. The glorious result of being chosen by Jesus and responding to Him by a lifestyle of abiding in Him is to bear fruit that glorifies the Father (15:8), to experience joy in our heart (15:11), and to be used to love people by helping them and by inspiring them to love Jesus more (15:12). These are the things which Jesus had in mind when He said, “I have chosen you.”

>8“By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit…11that My joy may remain in you… 16I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you. (Jn 15:8, 11, 16)

B. We are called to make the Father look attractive to unbelievers in a fallen world. Some unbelievers will ask us the reason for the hope that is in us (1 Pet. 3:15)—they will ask how we live with peace and contentment even in difficult circumstances and why we are kind to people who mistreat us.

>15But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense [answer] to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you… (1 Pet. 3:15)

1. We can tell them it is because we enjoy our relationship with God and that our conversation with Him around His Word is delightful.

2. We feel pleasure in obeying Him even when it requires that we deny fleshly comforts.

3. We have joy in His excellent leadership in difficult circumstances instead of being offended or afraid, being sure that it will eventually work for our good (Rom. 8:28) even if it takes years to see.

>28And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. 29For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son… (Rom 8:28-29)

C. “God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.” –John Piper

## II. GOD CHOSE HIS PEOPLE FOR FRIENDSHIP AND FRUITFULNESS (JN. 15:16)

A. We are to proclaim or give witness to “the praises of Him” by magnifying His excellencies (Phil. 3:8) or how attractive He is—that we enjoy our relationship with Him and trust His leadership (Rom. 8:28). This is synonymous to bearing fruit that glorifies the Father (Jn. 15:8).

>9But you are a chosen generation [people]…that you may proclaim [give witness to] the praises of Him who called you…into His marvelous light… (1 Pet. 2:9)

>8…I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ… (Phil. 3:8)

B. I have prayed many times, “Lord let me see what Paul saw about Jesus so that I can live like Paul lived—with wholehearted dedication love to Jesus.”
