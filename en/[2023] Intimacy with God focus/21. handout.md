# Session #21 Ziklag: David's Revelation of God's Delight in Him

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STUMBLING AND FAILING IN OUR FAITH

A. Jesus told Peter that he would stumble by denying Him, but that his faith would not fail (Mt. 26:31; Lk. 22:31-34). Stumbling refers to a short-term compromise. Our faith failing speaks of quitting, of giving up our wholehearted pursuit of God and seeking to walk in the fullness of His plan for us.

>31“All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night…” (Mt. 26:31)

>31“Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 32But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren… 34…Peter, the rooster shall not crow…before you will deny…that you know Me.” (Lk. 22:31-34)

B. King David is a premier example of one who trusted God’s love in times of failure and difficulty. The Lord called him a man after God’s heart—he was committed to obeying the commands of God’s heart, studying the emotions of God’s heart, and contending for the purposes of God’s heart.

>14“The LORD has sought for Himself a man after His own heart…” (1 Sam. 13:14)

C. The Spirit is raising up leaders (shepherds) with a heart for God like David had (Jer. 3:15).

>15“I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who will feed you with knowledge…” (Jer. 3:15)

## II. DAVID’S COMPROMISES BEFORE HIS GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ZIKLAG

A. David’s first compromise was to lie to the high priest Ahimelech in the city of Nob (1 Sam. 21:1-9).

>1David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech…said to him, “Why are you alone…?” 2David said…“The king has ordered me on business…3Give me five loaves of bread… 8I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons…because the king’s business required haste.” 9So the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine…there it is…take it.” (1 Sam. 21:1-9)

B. David’s second compromise was to lie to King Achish by pretending to be insane. David fled to the land of the Philistines to join Achish, the king over the Philistine city of Gath (1 Sam. 21:10-14)

C. The prophet Gad gave the Lord’s command to David to return home to Judah (1 Sam. 22:5).

>3Then David went from there [Adullam] to Mizpah of Moab…5Now the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go to the land of Judah.” (1 Sam. 22:3-5)

D. David’s third compromise was to seek to avenge himself against Nabal (1 Sam. 25:13). His fourth compromise was to disobey God’s command from a prophet to stay in Judah (22:5).

>1David said in his heart, “Now I shall perish someday by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape to the land of the Philistines.” (1 Sam. 27:1)

E. David went back to Achish, the Philistine king. David’s plan in 27:1 appeared to work.

>4It was told Saul that David fled to Gath; so he sought him no more…
6Achish gave him Ziklag… 7…the time that David dwelt [with] the Philistines was one year and four months. (1 Sam. 27:4-7)

F. David’s fifth compromise in this season was to lie to King Achish (1 Sam. 27:8-12). Achish trusted David and asked him to join him in fighting against Israel (1 Sam. 28:1-2). The Philistine leaders did not trust David, so they refused to allow him to participate (1 Sam. 29:1-11).

>8David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites…10Then Achish would say, “Where have you made a raid today?” And David would say, “Against the southern area of Judah…” 11David would save neither man nor woman alive, to bring news to Gath, saying, “Lest they should inform on us…” And thus was his behavior all the time he dwelt in the country of the Philistines. 12So Achish believed David, saying, “He has made his people Israel utterly abhor him; therefore he will be my servant forever.” (1 Sam. 27:8-12)

## III. DAVID’S GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ZIKLAG (1 SAM. 30)

A. David’s experiences in Ziklag give us insight into what he understood about God’s heart. He spent sixteen months at Ziklag (1 Sam. 27-31). During this season, David stumbled in compromise and was tested by the loss of his family, the burning of his city and the betrayal of his friends, yet he did not draw back from God. Rather, he set his heart to pursue the Lord and to trust His mercy and love.

>1David and his men came to Ziklag…the Amalekites had…attacked Ziklag…3David and his men came to the city, and there it was, burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive. 4David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to weep… 6David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved… (1 Sam. 30:1-6)

B. David strengthened himself in God and inquired of, or asked, the Lord what to do (1 Sam. 30:6-8). He did not let his stumbling in sin result in the failing of his faith by giving up his vision to fully seek the Lord. David recovered all (1 Sam. 30:9-31). At this time, Saul died in a battle (1 Sam. 31).

>6David was greatly distressed…But David strengthened himself in the Lord… 8David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I pursue this troop?”…He answered him, “Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them…” 18David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away… (1 Sam. 30:6-18)

C. The title of Psalm 18 tells us that David wrote it on the day God delivered him from Saul.

>1I will love You, O LORD, my strength…19He also brought me out into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me… 35 …Your gentleness has made me great. (Ps. 18:1, 19, 35)

>4But there is [mercy] forgiveness with You, that You may be feared. (Ps. 130:4)

D. The title of Psalm 56 informs us that David wrote this psalm while with Achish in the Ziklag years.

>8You number my wanderings; put my tears into Your bottle; are they not in Your book? 9When I cry out to You, then my enemies will turn back; this I know, because God is for me. (Ps. 56:8-9)
