# Session #10 The Most Glorious Life: Empowered to Glorify God

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF LIVING TO GLORIFY GOD

A. In John 15:7-8, Jesus emphasized the promise and privilege of answered prayer that glorifies God. The most glorious life is to live being empowered to glorify God by bearing fruit and by engaging in breakthrough prayer through intimacy and intercession (Jn. 15:1-8).

>7“If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done… 8By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit…” (Jn. 15:7-8)

B. If you abide in Me: The main activity of a believer related to growing in God is to abide in Christ. It involves three things: talking with God, applying His promises, and obeying His leadership. Abiding in Christ speaks of our on-going dialogue with God with active trust in His Word (promises, warnings, doctrines, etc.) and a spirit of obedience flowing from mutual affection.

C. My words abide in you: Jesus’ “words” refer to His teachings and what He speaks to us by the Spirit. We are to be absorbed in conversation with Him related to His teachings and promises.

1. Jesus’ word abiding in us empowers us in several ways including the following:  
a). To sustain an on-going conversation with Him (that we might love, serve, and obey Him);  
b). To boldly and clearly speak His word as faithful witnesses in the cultural wars (Ps. 2);  
c). To be able to equip others to follow Jesus and understand His end-time plans (Dan. 11:33).

2. The greatest pleasure available to the human race is when “God reveals God to the human spirit” as the Spirit reveals and writes the Scripture on our heart (Heb. 10:16; cf. Lk. 24:32).

>16…I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them. (Heb. 10:16)

3. David said that the Scripture is perfect and has power to transform and delight our heart. We are to be loyal to Jesus’ teaching as the only perfect and reliable guide to true spirituality.

>7The law of the LORD [God’s Word] is perfect, converting [transforming] the soul… 8rejoicing the heart…enlightening the eyes… 10More to be desired are they than gold… sweeter than honey… 11And in keeping them there is great reward. (Ps. 19:7-11)

4. David understood the delight and power for fruitfulness found in meditating on God's Word

>1Blessed is the man…2[whose] his delight is in [the Scripture]…he meditates day and night. 3He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit… (Ps. 1:1-3)

5. The Lord told Joshua that he would be empowered to be courageous, obedient, and prosperous by engaging in long and loving meditation on God’s word (Josh. 1:7-9).

>7Only be strong and very courageous…8This Book of the Law [the Scripture]…you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do [obey]…all that is written in it. Then you will make your way prosperous, and…have good success. (Josh. 1:7-8)

## II. ASK WHAT YOU DESIRE AND IT SHALL BE DONE FOR YOU (JN. 15:7)

A. Jesus promised that, when His people pray in agreement with Him, He shall answer them. In John 13-17, Jesus emphasized 5 times His promise to answer “whatever we ask for” in God’s will (14:13-14; 15:7, 16; 16:23). One of the most effective ways to bear fruit is by our prayers.

>7“If you abide in Me [intimacy with God], and My words abide in you [mediation on the Word], you will ask what you desire [intercession], and it shall be done for you.” (Jn. 15:7)

B. There is a deep connection between what we pray and how we think and live by abiding in His Word. His words are in our heart, and when we pray our words are in His heart.

C. There is no limit to the power of the life that is in Jesus the true Vine; the only limit is in our cultivating a life of abiding and engaging in prayer that agrees with Him. He responds by revealing His heart, giving us direction, blessing our circumstances, transforming our emotions, touching our loved ones, reviving the Church, saving the lost, releasing justice, impacting society, and so on.

D. While not every believer is called to preach, we are all called to pray. Prayer is essential for our spiritual well-being. We must make every effort to establish our prayer life, because it will not develop on its own. The Spirit will help all who desire to grow in prayer. The results are worth whatever it takes to cultivate a strong prayer life.

E. Being a person of prayer is the most important calling in one’s life; it is a higher calling than being a spouse, parent, pastor, preacher, or leader in the marketplace. We will all become far better spouses, parents, and leaders as we take time to grow in prayer. Intercession is our most effective spiritual weapon to support and help our loved ones. It is one of our deepest expressions of love.

F. By cultivating intimacy with Jesus, we “soak in His beauty and glory” and then contend for breakthrough for the nations. In 15:7, “Mary of Bethany meets Anna the intercessor” (Lk. 2:37).

G. Jesus’ desire is that we bear much fruit that glorifies the Father or that makes Him look attractive. Fruitfulness includes possessing love, purity, gratitude, etc. and inspiring it in others.

>8“By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit…” (Jn. 15:8)

H. We can bear fruit in at least three ways—

1. Character: We walk out the 8 beatitudes in our speech and actions (Mt. 5:3-12). Bearing much fruit is not mostly about how many people we lead to the Lord.

2. Words: We speak as faithful witnesses of Jesus and His message, which includes the Sermon on the Mount lifestyle (Mt. 5-7) and His views on sin, judgment, eternity, finances, etc.

3. Deeds: We demonstrate God’s glory through our practical service and ministry to others.

I. A fruit-bearing disciple is part of Jesus’ gift of love to the Father. This is the most glorious life. To glorify God means that our life gives insight into the Father’s attractiveness. We glorify God in when we delight in His beauty by treasuring, enjoying, celebrating, and by declaring it to others. “God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.” John Piper
