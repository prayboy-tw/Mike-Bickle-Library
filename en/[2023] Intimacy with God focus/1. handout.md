# Session #1 Intimacy with God: Core to the Forerunner Message

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. JOHN THE BAPTIST SAW JESUS AS THE BRIDEGROOM GOD

A. John the Baptist was the first person in the New Testament to reveal Jesus as the Bridegroom God (Jn. 3:29). John was the first to testified of himself as a “friend of the bridegroom.”

>29He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled. (Jn. 3:29)

B. Jesus is the Bridegroom: He is a bridegroom in the essence of His personality. He feels, thinks, and acts as a bridegroom because He is a bridegroom forever. He has tender love and burns with desire for His people. The OT prophets spoke of God as a Bridegroom King (Isa. 54:5; 62:4-5; Jer. 2:2; 3:20; Ezek. 16:8; Hos. 2:16-20).

C. Jesus has the Bride: Jesus has a bride because God promised Him a prepared Bride at the end of natural history. From God’s point of view, Jesus already possessed His Bride.

>7The marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready. (Rev. 19:7)

1. From ages past, the Father promised to give provide a prepared Bride for His worthy Son. Jesus endured the cross in order to purchase her.

2. Jesus our Bridegroom King has the Bride and knows how to protect her.

3. We are to rejoice in His desire for us and in our great value to Him.

D. Friend of the Bridegroom: John functioned as a “friend of the Bridegroom.” This speaks of those who share a specific message—the Bridegroom message, a fasted lifestyle, and a ministry style to not draw the attention of people to themselves but to Jesus. The friend of the Bridegroom role is comparable to the best man or the maid of honor at a wedding whose concern is that the Bride be undistracted by other things but be focused on receiving the embrace of the Bridegroom.

E. Who stands: John was diligent to be attentive to stand in God’s presence in worship, prayer, and feeding on God’s Word.

1. This includes the Mary of Bethany lifestyle (Lk. 10:42).

>42But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part…” (Lk. 10:42)

2. Standing before God is one of primary responsibilities of a prophetic messenger (Jer. 23:18). This is a priestly function as seen in the Levites (Deut. 10:8), Elijah (1 Kgs. 17:1), the two witnesses (Rev. 11:4), and Gabriel as one who stands before God (Lk. 1:19).

>18Who has stood in the counsel of the Lord, and has perceived and heard His word? (Jer. 23:18)

F. Who hears him: He was faithful to respond with obedience regardless of the price.

G. Because of the Bridegroom's voice: John grew in understanding of Jesus as the Bridegroom God

H. Rejoices greatly with joy: John was empowered with joy even in context to the difficulty of a fasted lifestyle while living in the desert by receiving the revelation of the Bridegroom.

## II. THE BRIDEGROOM MESSAGE IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE FORERUNNER MESSAGE

A. The Word and the Spirit emphasize Jesus as Bridegroom, King, and Judge at the end of the age. Jesus is a King with great power, a Bridegroom with deep desire for relationship with His people, and a Judge with righteous zeal to remove everything that hinders love—there is no contradiction!

B. John 13-17 is the greatest teaching given by the greatest teacher! It was given at the Last Supper. Millions of believers will be equipped by the truths, promises, and commands set forth in these 5 chapters to be overcomers walking as Jesus’ prepared Bride (Rev. 19:7) in context to the most intense persecutions, temptations, and difficulties in history (Mt. 24:21). The truths in John 13-17 define the way of the heart of the overcoming Bride in the end times.

>7“…the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.” (Rev. 19:7)

C. Summary of the forerunner message: The beauty of Jesus as Bridegroom, King, and Judge returning to Jerusalem to rule all the nations and to fill the entire earth with the glory of God. This includes His plans to equip a global prayer movement leading to the release of unprecedented power resulting in the “billion soul harvest,” the salvation of Israel (Rom. 11:26), and the transformation of the Church to be a unified family (Jn. 17:23), and a prepared Bride (Rev. 19:7).

D. The Bridegroom message is a call to intimacy with God by encountering His heart and walking in partnership with Him in a spirit of abandonment. The Spirit reveals to us the deep things of God’s heart—His emotions and commitments—and empowers us to respond in wholehearted love.

E. Some ministries either refuse or emphasize just one of these three truths over the other two.

1. To understand Jesus as the Bridegroom without seeing Him as the King and Judge may lead to sentimentality without obedience and misunderstanding of His end-time plans.

2. To understand Jesus as the King without seeing Him as the Bridegroom and Judge may lead to an authoritarian view of God or to a misunderstanding of why God releases power through His people. This leads some to be overly focused on growing their ministry influence.

3. To understand Jesus as the Judge without seeing Him as the Bridegroom King may lead to a harsh view of God or a wrong understanding about judgment resulting in anger or offense.

>54[John]…“Lord, do You want us to command fire to…consume them, just as Elijah did?” 55He…rebuked them…“You do not know what manner of spirit you are of. (Lk. 9:54-55)
