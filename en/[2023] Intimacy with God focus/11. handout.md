# Session #11 Transformed by Beholding God’s Beauty Narrative

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. DAVID’S DETERMINATION TO SEARCH OUT GOD’S BEAUTY

A. One of King David’s lifelong goals was to intentionally search out God’s beauty (Ps. 27:4). He wrote Psalm 27 in a time of personal and national conflict. He had a long history of cultivating understanding of God's beauty. He drew on it causing him to not fear. Delighting in the God's beauty is essential to walking in victory—in times of escalating fear, lust, offense, and violence.

>2When the wicked came against me…3Though an army may encamp against me, my heart shall not fear… 4One thing…will I seek…all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD… (Ps. 27:2-4)

B. The beauty narrative: We embrace the truth about a beautiful God who has a beautiful plan for our life, in which He uses His power to impart beauty into our life that continues forever (Rom. 8:28). All things work together for “good”— especially in terms of the growth of love and humility in us.

>28And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God… (Rom. 8:28)

C. The dark narrative: The enemy wants us to entrap us into a negative narrative of how bad we are treated, how hard things are, what we do not have, how much we fail, and how worthless our life is.

## II. JESUS IMPARTS HIS BEAUTY

A. The beauty that Jesus possesses is the very beauty that He imparts to His people by the Spirit.

>1The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me…3to give them beauty for ashes. (Isa. 61:1, 3)

B. Jesus progressively imparts His beauty to us as we make daily choices to walk in humility and to trust His leadership. He sees these virtues as godly seeds growing in the garden of our heart.

>4…let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle [humility] and quiet spirit [from trusting Him], which is very precious in the sight of God. (1 Pet. 3:4)

1. Incorruptible beauty: God sees our growth in humility and in trusting Him as incorruptible beauty, or beauty that will never diminish. It will last throughout the age to come.

2. Very precious: The beauty of humility and trusting Him is very dear and valuable to God.

3. Gentle spirit: Some translate gentle as humble. Every choice for humility is beautiful to God.

4. Quiet spirit: Having a quiet spirit speaks walking in peace instead of fear because of trusting Jesus’ excellent leadership in our life, especially in times of difficulty (Isa. 30:15)

5. Hidden beauty: This passage provides significant insight to the body of Christ enabling us to know that God sees beauty in the heart of His people. The challenge with is that this beauty is hidden from our five senses and we only know of it because the Scripture reveals it.

C. The beauty of our life is “hidden” in Christ—it will be fully manifested when Jesus returns. Thus, only after Jesus appears at His second coming, will we will see the full story and glory of our life. We do not have to wait until the resurrection to rejoice with gratitude over the real storyline of our life, because our life is being led by a beautiful God who imparts beauty in our life.

>3…your life is hidden with Christ in God. 4When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear [the hidden glory of God in you will be seen] with Him in glory [beauty]. (Col. 3:3-4)

D. Life in this age is the “womb of eternity.” There is continuity with this life in the age to come. The Lord calls the life choices to love, obey, and trust Him as “great” in His sight (Mt. 5:19).

>19…whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom… (Mt. 5:19)

E. Paul elaborated on the transforming power of beholding the Lord’s beauty. Beholding God’s beauty includes seeing His beauty in creation, redemption, and His leadership of history, but it also highlights the beauty that He imparts to His people—the “beauty narrative”

>18We all…beholding…the glory [beauty] of the Lord, are being transformed… (2 Cor. 3:18)

F. Jesus is committed to fill the earth and all society with His glory—His beauty, love, humility, etc. (Num. 14:21; Ps. 37:11; 45:4; Hab. 2:14; Zeph. 3:12; Mt. 5:5; 11:29; 1 Pet. 3:4).

>14For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory [beauty] of the LORD… (Hab. 2:14)

>2You are fairer [more beautiful] than the sons of men…3Gird Your sword upon Your thigh [Jesus at Armageddon]… 4In Your majesty ride prosperously because of truth, humility, and righteousness…5Your arrows are sharp…the peoples [nations] fall under You. (Ps. 45:2-5)

G. Isaiah prophesied that the Spirit would emphasize Jesus’ beauty in the generation of His return (Isa. 33:17; cf. 4:2; 28:5; 61:3; 62:3-5), and that God’s people will find strength by delighting in it (33:6). The “beauty narrative” will bring strength in a time of escalating lust, fear, and persecution.

>6“…knowledge [God's beauty] will be the stability of your times, and the strength of salvation… 17“Your eyes will see the King in His beauty…” (Isa. 33:6, 17)

H. Isaiah was undone when he saw the Lord's holiness or transcendent beauty (6:1-5). Seeing God's holiness empowers happy holiness in affectionate obedience with a spirit of gratitude and humility.

>1…I saw the Lord sitting on a throne…2Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 3And one cried to another and said: “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory!”… 5I said: “Woe is me, for I am undone…for my eyes have seen the King…” (Isa. 6:1-5)

I. The word holy means to be “separate from”—There are two applications of God’s holiness. God is holy or separated from all that is sinful. This speaks of His purity and moral perfection. God is holy or separated from all that is common or created. He is infinitely superior to all that exists—speaking of His transcendent beauty—in all His attributes love, purity, wisdom, power, etc.

J. Paul prayed for others to receive greater insight into the knowledge of God's beauty (Eph. 1:16-19).
