# Session #5 Three Prophetic Time Frames in the End Times

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. THREE PROPHETIC TIME FRAMES

A. There are 3 prophetic time frames related to the final 7 years of this age along with 2 key dates–Israel becoming a nation (1948) and gaining control over Jerusalem (1967). The three time frames (Dan. 9:27; Mt. 24:8; 1 Thes. 5:2-3) are the beginning of birth pains (possibly starting in 1948 or 1967), worldwide counterfeit peace and safety (3½ years), and the Great Tribulation.

B. All three time frames occur in context to one generation. When all the signs spoken by Jesus in Matthew 24 accelerate in the same generation, believers are to know that they are living in the generation that He will return (Mt. 24:33-34). A generation may last 100 years (Gen. 15:13-16).

>33When you see all these things, know that it is near…34this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place…36Of that day and hour no one knows… (Mt. 24:33-36)

1. The first mention of all these things (24:33) refers to those occurring before and during the Great Tribulation as described in 24:5-28, starting with the beginning of birth pains.

>8All these are but the beginning of the birth pains. (Mt. 24:8; ESV).

2. The second mention of all these things (24:34) refers to the things that occur after the Great Tribulation, related to Jesus coming on the clouds to the earth (Mt. 24:29-31).

## II. BEGINNING OF BIRTH PAINS: 1ST PROPHETIC TIME FRAME BEFORE JESUS RETURNS

A. Jesus, the apostles, and the OT prophets prophesied various signs of the times that will alert God’s people (who are alive in the generation that Jesus returns) that His return is imminent.
For the first time in history, most of these are increasing and making headline news globally.

B. Jesus identified 12 negative “sign trends” and one positive trend (gospel preached in all nations) that will characterize this time (Mt. 24:4-8, 14; Mk. 13:5-8; Lk. 21:7-18)—false christs, war, ethnic conflict (nation [ethnos] against nation), economic warfare (kingdom against kingdom), famines, pestilences, earthquakes, troubles (Mk. 13:8), commotions (chaotic events; Lk. 21:9), fearful sights (Lk. 21:11), signs from heaven (Lk. 21:11), and persecution (Lk. 21:12-19).

>3…“What will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?”…5“For many will come in My name…and will deceive many. 6And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars… 7For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes…8All these are the beginning of sorrows [birth pains, ESV, NIV]. (Mt. 24:3-8)

C. The earth will go through a “birth canal,” resulting in a new world order—the Millennium.

>8Who has heard such a thing?...Shall the earth be made to give birth in one day? Or shall a nation be born at once? For as soon as Zion was in labor, she gave birth to her children. 9Shall I bring to the time of birth, and not cause delivery?” says the LORD. (Isa. 66:8-9)

## III. WORLDWIDE COUNTERFEIT PEACE AND SAFETY: 2ND PROPHETIC TIME FRAME

A. Paul prophesied a “counterfeit peace and safety” that will end suddenly when the destruction associated with the Great Tribulation begins (1 Thes. 5:3). This counterfeit time of peace will continue for the first 3½ years of the final 7 years of this age.

>2For you yourselves know perfectly that the Day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. 3For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction [Great Tribulation] comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape. (1 Thes. 5:2-3)

B. The counterfeit peace will be the result of the Antichrist negotiating a peace treaty between Israel and the Islamic nations (Dan. 9:27). Initially, the Antichrist will be seen as a man of peace.

>27Then he [Antichrist] shall confirm a covenant [peace treaty] with many [Israel and Islamic nations] for one week [7-year period]; but in the middle of the week [after 3½ years] he shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering [breaking his covenant with Israel]. (Dan. 9:27)

C. A worldwide religious network called the Harlot Babylon will be operating during this time. It will be a religion of toleration, without absolutes. The kings of the earth will participate in it. This religious network will have the power to kill the saints who oppose it. (Rev. 17:6)

## IV. THE GREAT TRIBULATION: 3RD PROPHETIC TIME FRAME BEFORE JESUS RETURNS

A. The Great Tribulation will begin in the middle of the final 7 years of this age and will last for 3½ years. It will be the most difficult and the most important 3½ years in human history.

>21There will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time…22Unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved [physically]… (Mt. 24:21-22)

B. Optimum environment: God will establish the optimum environment for His people to walk in love and purity. What Satan means for evil, God will use for good to train His people. God uses the least severe means to bring the greatest number of people to the deepest level of love (Rom. 8:28)

C. Jesus will make a royal procession to His throne in Jerusalem. It will be a 3-stage procession that includes many events—He will travel across the sky in glory, then on the land through Jordan (Edom), and finally into Jerusalem (and stand on the Mount of Olives) to be crowned King.
