# Session #4 Four Pastoral Challenges in the End Times

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. WE ARE ALERTED BY 4 PASTORAL CHALLENGES HIGHLIGHTED BY JESUS

A. People must understand the biblical narrative for what will happen and why it will happen, or they will by default embrace a secular narrative of the events, making them more vulnerable to being overcome by fear, offense, lust, and deception.

B. Jesus highlighted 4 responses that will greatly challenge many people’s faith in the end times: F.O.L.D.—Fear (Lk. 21:26), Offense (Mt. 24:10), Lust (Lk. 21:34), and Deception (Mt. 24:11)

>26“…men’s hearts failing them from fear… 34“But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing [lust, immorality, etc.], drunkenness… and that Day [Jesus’ second coming] come on you unexpectedly.” (Lk. 21:26, 34)

>10“Then many will be offended... 11Many false prophets will rise up and deceive many.” (Mt. 24:10-11)

1. Fear: The hearts of people will be overcome with fear (Lk. 21:26), if they are not properly equipped in the Word and walking in the Spirit. This applies to believers and unbelievers.

2. Offense: Many will be offended at God and one another. Some will be offended at Jesus’ leadership—since they were taught that they would be raptured before the trouble intensified.

3. Lust: The word carousing speaks of self-indulgence, with the main idea being immorality. Often people who are overwhelmed by fear, anxiety, or offense seek relief from their stress in drunkenness, drugs, immorality, etc. They “self-medicate” with lust seeking relief from pain.

4. Deception: Some of the most dangerous false prophets will be popular social commentators and media personalities who are dignified, good-looking, caring, intelligent, and well-spoken. They will promote a social narrative that is contrary to the biblical narrative and values.

C. The escalating fear, offense, lust, and deception will result in many falling away from Jesus. Paul prophesied of a “falling away” in the end times (1 Tim. 4:1-2; 2 Tim. 3:1-7; 4:3-5; cf. Heb. 6:4-6; 10:26-31, 39; 2 Pet. 2:1-3, 20-22; 3:17). This will be one of the most tragic realities in history. Paul presented it as being as obvious and significant as the appearing of the Antichrist on the world stage.

>3Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day [Jesus’ return] will not come unless the falling away comes first and the man of sin [Antichrist] is revealed. (2 Thes. 2:3)
