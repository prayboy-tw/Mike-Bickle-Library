# Session #8 The Great Tribulation: A Victorious Church

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. THE GREAT TRIBULATION: 3RD PROPHETIC TIME FRAME BEFORE JESUS RETURNS

A. The Great Tribulation begins in the middle of the final 7 years of this age and will last for 3½ years.

B. Jesus identified 8 signs that occur in the 3½ years of the Tribulation (Mt. 24:14-28; Lk. 21:20, 24). In Matthew 24, He highlighted 5 signs (24:14-24)—2 are positive trends in the gospel being preached in all nations (24:14) and the Sabbath restored in Israel (24:20) and one terrible event—the abomination of desolation, (24:15) with 2 negative trends—unprecedented deaths (24:22) and false prophets doing miracles (24:24). Luke identified an additional 3 negative events (21:20)—Jerusalem being surrounded by armies (21:20), their people being killed and/or led away captive into all nations (21:24) and Jerusalem being trampled by Gentiles (Lk. 21:24).

>14“And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached…to all the nations…15When you see the ‘abomination of desolation’…21Then there will be great tribulation… (Mt. 24:14-21)

>20“When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies… 24They will…be led away captive into all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles…”(Lk 21:20, 24)

C. The Great Tribulation will be the most difficult yet the most important 3½ years in history. There will be two severe waves of death—the first will claim one-fourth of earth’s population (Rev. 6:8), the second an additional one-third (Rev. 9:15)—totaling 50% of the earth’s population.

D. God uses the least severe means to bring the greatest number of people to the deepest level of love (Rom. 8:28).

## II. THE ANTICHRIST’S POWER, DECEPTION AND DESTRUCTION

A. The Antichrist (Rev. 13:1-10) will wage war against Jesus and His people as the most powerful leader in history. In light of his 10-nation confederation, he will have the largest army and religious network using demonic miracles (2 Thes. 2:9) to deceive and political processes to kill resistors (Rev. 13:12-18). The dramatic healing of the Antichrist’s head wound will be the great catalytic event that thrusts the Antichrist into world prominence (Rev. 13:3, 12, 14).

>3…his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled and followed the beast... (Rev. 13:3)

B. The abomination of desolation is the primary sign that the Great Tribulation has begun. The saints will see it (Mt. 24:15). Two components of the abomination are the image and the mark of the Beast (Rev. 13:15-18). The Antichrist will declare himself to be God (2 Thes. 2:4), and the False Prophet will set an image of the Antichrist in the temple and demand all to worship him (Rev. 13:15).

>15“Therefore when you see the ‘abomination of desolation’…standing in the holy place”… 21Then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world… 29Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened…30all the tribes of the earth…will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds…31He will send His angels…and they will gather [the rapture] together His elect from…one end of heaven to the other.” (Mt. 24:15-31)

C. The battle for Jerusalem: This is the primary battle in the Armageddon campaign. God will draw the wicked leaders of all the nations to the battle of Jerusalem to defeat them before the eyes of the whole world (Joel 3:2, 12; Zech. 12:3; 14:2; Zeph. 3:8; Ezek. 38:4). They will lay siege to Jerusalem and the surrounding region of Judah (Zech. 12:2). Satan will send demons to gather the kings of the earth to the battle of Jerusalem (Rev. 16:13-16). God and Satan will be at work in
gathering the nations to Jerusalem but for different reasons.

>20“When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies… 24They will fall by the…sword, and
be led away captive into all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles…” (Lk. 21:20, 24)

>2I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem; the city shall be taken…half of the city shall go into captivity…3Then the LORD will…fight against those nations… (Zech. 14:2-3)

## III. THE VICTORIOUS CHURCH: A MATURE BRIDE

A. During the final 3½ years, two prophets living in Jerusalem will do mighty miracles (Rev. 11:3-6).

>3I will give power to my two witnesses… 5fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies… 6These have power to shut heaven, so that no rain falls…and they have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with all plagues… (Rev. 11:3-6)

>17“…in the last days…I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy…19I will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath…” (Acts 2:17-19)

B. The gospel will be proclaimed in power to all nations (Mt. 24:14; Rev. 7:9; 14:6; 15:4).

C. God's seal, trumpet, and bowl judgments will destroy Harlot Babylon and the Antichrist’s empire.

>3Then another angel, having a golden censer…he was given much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints… 4The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God…5The angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth… 6The seven angels [with]…seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. (Rev. 8:3-6)

D. The church will be victorious (Eph. 5:27) as a mature Bride for Jesus (Rev. 12:11; 15:2; 19:7).

>27that He might present her to Himself a glorious church… (Eph. 5:27)

>11And they [saints] overcame him [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb… (Rev. 12:11)

>2I saw…a sea of glass…and those who have the victory over the beast… (Rev 15:2)

>7…for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready. (Rev. 19:7)

>35And Some of those…shall fall [martyred], to refine them, purify them, and make them white.
(Dan. 11:35)

E. When Jesus returns to earth He will destroy the Antichrist.

>8And then the lawless one [the Antichrist] will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming. (2 Thes. 2:8)
