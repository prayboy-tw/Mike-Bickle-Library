# Session #24 Emerging Challenges to the End Time Victorious Church

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. PROPHETIC CERTAINTY: THE TRUTH OF A VICTORIOUS UNIFIED CHURCH

A. Both light (glory) and darkness (sin) will increase in the end times (Isa. 60:1-2; Mt. 13:30, 39).

>1Arise, shine; for your light has come!...2the darkness shall cover the earth, and deep darkness the people; but the LORD will arise over you, and His glory will be seen upon you. (Isa. 60:1-2)

A. Jesus is returning for a spiritually vibrant church that walks in victory as a prepared Bride (Jn. 17:21-26; Rev. 19:7; 22:17). This implies millions of “weak” people will walk in mature love, peace, joy, courage, and unity by God's grace. Jesus is a much better leader than Satan is a deceiver.

>7…for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready. (Rev. 19:7)

>22The glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one… (Jn. 17:22)

B. The greatest outpouring of the Spirit in history will occur in the end times, resulting in a Church mature in love (Jn. 17:21-26; Eph. 5:26-27). The Spirit will establish the first commandment in first place in the global body of Christ even as there will be a vast harvest—"the billion soul harvest” (Mt. 24:14; Rev. 7:9; 14:6). The end-time Church will walk in power that far surpasses the book of Acts including healings, miraculous provision (food, water, etc.), protection (Goshen principle), deliverances (open prison doors, etc.), and prophetic direction and revelation (dreams and visions).

## II. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

A. Acceleration of new platforms that will allow oppressive government on a global scale

1. New global governance: World Health Organization and World Economic Forum

2. Digital identities and currencies: Goverments will be able to shut down peoples finances and traveling and more

3. Surveillance state— China with a social credit score

B. Acceleration of new platforms that will replace hundreds of millions of jobs

C. MetaVerse platforms open the doors for people immersed into darkness Before Jesus returns, sin, and deception will reach their greatest heights in history, resulting in a falling away from the faith (Mt. 24:9-13; 2 Thes. 2:3; 1 Tim. 4:1-2; 2 Tim. 3:1-7; 4:3-5).

>23And in the latter time…when the transgressors [sinners] have reached their fullness, a king [the Antichrist] shall arise. (Dan. 8:23)

>21They did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts. (Rev. 9:21)

## III. DIVISIONS THAT WILL CHALLENGE FAITHFUL BELIEVERS

A. Jesus prayed with authority into “God’s grand family plan” that will result in Jews and Gentiles walking in deep love, humility, and gratitude toward one another forever (Jn 17:23; Eph. 3:3-10).

>22The glory which You gave Me I have given them…23that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have...loved them as You have loved Me. (Jn. 17:22-23)

B. Betrayal culture in the Church

>10And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. 11Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. 12And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. (Mt 24:10–12)

>16You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends… (Lk. 21:16)

>12Now brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death. (Mk. 13:12)

C. Micah described the spiritual crisis in his day—society was filled with sin and betrayal (7:1-6). The wickedness and betrayal in Micah’s day will be surpassed in generation the Lord returns. Micah laments the lack of godly leaders faithful to the Lord in governmental roles or in the public square (7:2-3). He identified the primary leaders who will scheme together—princes (government leaders), judges (court systems), and the great men (leaders in finance, media, social icons, etc.—and seek gifts, bribes, and “pay-offs” from those under them.

>1Woe is me!…2The faithful man has perished from the earth, and there is no one upright among men…every man hunts his brother… 3the prince asks for gifts, the judge seeks a bribe, and the great man utters his evil desire; so they scheme together… (Mic. 7:1-3).

D. Micah warned the people not to trust some of their friends or family members because they might betray them (7:5-6) in order to avoid an economic penalty or to gain an economic advantage (7:3).

>5Do not trust in a friend… 6For son dishonors father, daughter rises against her mother… a man’s enemies are the men of his own household. (Mic. 7:5-6)

## IV. THE CHALLENGE OF REPLACEMENT THEOLOGY IN THE CHRUCH

A. We must take a stand against replacement theology because bad theology leads to bad practice! Replacement theology has provided the rationale for much persecution against the Jewish people throughout Christian history. God has sovereignly ordained that Gentile believers provoke Israel to jealousy in the generation the Lord returns, resulting in all Israel being saved (Rom. 11:11, 25-26).

B. John described Satan’s desire to exterminate the Jewish people, using a prophetic picture of Israel as a woman being attacked by Satan as a dragon (Rev. 12:1-17). Satan is the father of anti-Semitism and has had a special hatred, and rage throughout all history in seeking to destroy the Jewish people.

>13The dragon [Satan]…persecuted the woman [remnant of Israel]…15The serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman,.. 17The dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who…have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (Rev. 12:13-17)

C. The multitudes in the nations will all have to make a decision “for” or “against” Jesus’ leadership over Jerusalem in the end-time conflicts (Joel 3:14). I believe this will be a litmus test of obedience to Jesus’ leadership. We love Him; thus, we want to love who and what He loves (Zech. 8:2).

>1“…when I bring back the captives of Judah and Jerusalem, 2I will gather all nations…to the Valley of Jehoshaphat [Jerusalem]; I will enter into judgment with them there on account of My people…whom they have scattered among the nations; they have also divided up My land. 3They have cast lots for My people, have given a boy as payment for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine… 12Let the nations…come to the Valley of Jehoshaphat…I will judge all the surrounding nations… 14Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the Lord is near…” (Joel 3:1-14)

## V. HOSTILITY FROM THE WOKE CULTURE AND HARLOT BABYLON

A. Hostility from the woke culture: In Psalm 2. David prophesied that the nations would rise up in anger against Jesus’ leadership (2:1-3), seeking to remove the influence of His Word from society (2:3). This hostility will would reach its pinnacle in the generation of Jesus’ return. Kings speak of the heads of state; rulers include leaders in society—economic, educational, military, sports, media,
etc.

>1Why do the nations rage, and the people plot a vain thing? 2The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against His Anointed, saying, 3“Let us break Their bonds in pieces and cast away Their cords from us.” (Ps. 2:1-3)

B. These leaders will oppose the truth about Jesus and His definitions of salvation, love, grace, purity, and justice. They will see God’s Word in a negative light, as though it were bonds enslaving them and hindering “human potential,” and as cords binding them to His morality, godly ways, and truth. There is an unholy agenda accelerating, as many attack God’s commands with rage, seeking to remove His moral boundaries from society, including the sanctity of life, marriage, and sexuality.

C. Rage: The rage in society against Jesus will escalate far beyond merely voicing negative opinions against God’s people and truth to warring against God and His people using hate crimes, prison, and death. The conflict will eventually escalate to “war” (Rev. 11:7; 12:17; 13:7; 17:14; 19:19).

D. Before the angel shows John the wealth and counterfeit beauty of the Harlot religion, he shows him her inevitable judgment and sure defeat (v. 1). This system will fail and be utterly destroyed.

>1Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot... 2 with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication…5On her forehead a name was written...BABYLON THE GREAT, the mother of harlots and of the abominations of the earth. 6I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints… (Rev. 17:1-6)

E. The Harlot’s system will cause the nations to be drunk with her seductions that offer great benefits including humanitarian aid, unified religion (that minimizes wars) and a prosperous world economy. The nations will rejoice in her “goodness” and get drunk (intoxicated) with her “promises of compassion and theology of tolerance” based in deception.

>2 The inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication. (Rev. 17:2)

## VI. THE TRIBULATION TEMPLE AND THE TRAMPLING OF JERUSALEM (REV. 11:1-2)

A. John was told to measure the temple, altar, and its worshipers (11:1-2). The paradox and tension in the Tribulation temple being God’s temple (11:1; cf. 2 Thes. 2:4) is that the Antichrist will use it. One of the most controversial issues in the end times will be the role of the temple in Jerusalem.

>10I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. But when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.
11And he said to me, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings.” (Rev. 10:10-11)

>1I was given a reed like a measuring rod. And the angel stood, saying, “Rise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there. 2But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles.” (Rev. 11:1-2)

1. The Tribulation temple will be built in Jerusalem where Solomon’s temple was built. It will be built by religious Jews and desecrated by the Antichrist with the abomination of desolation (11:1-2; 13:12-18; cf. Mt. 24:15; 2 Thes. 2:4; Dan. 8:13; 9:27; 11:31, 36-37; 12:11).

2. The Tribulation temple is not the Millennial temple that will be built by Jesus (Ezek. 37:26-28; 40-48; cf. Isa. 2:3; 60:13; Jer. 33:18; Hab. 2:20; Hag. 2:7-9; Zech. 6:12-15; 14:16-21).

B. Measure the temple: To measure something spiritually means to evaluate it carefully and discern its spiritual quality and purpose. God’s people are to measure or carefully weigh the issues related to God’s purpose for allowing the Tribulation temple to be built.

1. The temptation of some will be to criticize all activities related to it, while others will be tempted to accept all the activities as good.

2. We must not embrace either extreme but discern the activities related to this future temple.

C. Jesus is described as measuring or evaluating the earth when He returns (Hab. 3:6).

>6He [Jesus] stood and measured the earth; He looked and startled the nations. (Hab. 3:6)

1. Amos saw a plumb line in God’s hand indicating that God “measured” Israel’s obedience.

>8The LORD said, “Amos, what do you see?” I said, “A plumb line.” Then the Lord said: “Behold, I am setting a plumb line in the midst of My people Israel…” (Amos 7:8)

2. During King Belshazzar’s royal feast in Babylon, a finger appeared and wrote on the wall that God had weighed or “measured” and evaluated his kingdom and found it lacking (Dan. 5:27).

>23And you [Belshazzar] have lifted yourself up against the Lord…25“And this is the inscription that was written [on the wall ] : MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN 26This is the interpretation of each word. MENE: God has numbered your kingdom… 27TEKEL: You have been weighed in the balances [measured], and found wanting; 28PERES: Your kingdom has been divided, and given to the…Persians.” (Dan 5:23-28)

D. Measure the altar: God’s people are to discern the worship and prayer that will be offered there. God has a purpose for God-fearing Jews to be involved in various temple activities at the altar. We are not to dismiss all their activities in the temple as worthless. However, the only way of salvation for these God-fearing Jews is through Jesus, not through their temple activities.

E. Measure those who worship there: God's people are to spiritually discern or pay attention to the people who worship there.

1. Some will be devout God-fearing Jews who do not believe in Jesus. (Those with sincere devotion to the God of Israel need to embrace Jesus to receive salvation). Some will be people worshiping the Antichrist in that temple. There will be both redemptive and blasphemous activities (abomination of desolation) related to the prayer, worship, or sacrifices offered at the altar. It will require true discernment.

2. Those eating the scroll will be able to measure this thing rightly in related to the temple and the crisis of the Gentiles trampling the Jerusalem.

F. Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles for 42 months (11:2). The court outside the temple may be given to the Gentiles (Muslims?) a few years before the severe trampling of Jerusalem begins. This court is outside of the temple proper—it was called “the court of the Gentiles” by some Jews.

>2Leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it [focus on it], for it has been given to the Gentiles. And they will tread the holy city underfoot for forty-two months. (Rev. 11:2)

1. Do not measure it: Believers are not to “measure” or focus on the fact that one day the court of the Gentiles will be given to Gentiles (especially the Muslims).

2. Tread the city underfoot: For Jerusalem to be tread under foot is symbolic of it being conquered and crushed to the ground. Grapes were trodden under foot (Judg. 9:27; Isa. 16:10; 63:2). Jerusalem will be trodden underfoot by the Antichrist’s armies (Zech. 12:2-3; 14:2)

>2I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem; the city shall be taken…
(Zech. 14:2)
