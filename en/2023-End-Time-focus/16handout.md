# Session #16 Persecution Unto the Fullness of All That God Ordained

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. PERSECUTION IS ALLOWED FOR THE BENEFIT OF GOD'S PEOPLE

A. Persecution is both a demonic attack to hinder our spiritual growth and a divine gift to enhance it.

B. God granted persecution (Phil. 1:29) that they may be transformed by it for their benefit in this age (1 Pet. 4:1, 14) and in the age to come (2 Cor. 4:17).

>1…for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, 2that he no longer should live the rest of his time…for the lusts of men... 14If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory…rests on you…[and] He is glorified. (1 Pet. 4:1-2, 14)

>17Our light affliction…is working for us a far more exceeding…weight of glory… (2 Cor. 4:17)

## II. PERSECUTION AS PROOF OF GOD’S GOOD LEADERSHIP: 4 EVIDENCES

A. Paul spoke of persecution as evidence or proof of God’s righteous judgment or wise leadership (2 Thes. 1:3-11). Paul identified 4 ways that give evidence that persecution benefits God’s people.

>3…your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all abounds…4so that… [we boast of]…your patience [perseverance] and faith in all your persecutions…that you endure, 5which is manifest evidence [proof] of the righteous judgment of God [good leadership], that you may be counted worthy of [prepared to experience more of] the kingdom…6since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with tribulation those who trouble you, 7and to give you rest… when the Lord Jesus is revealed… (2 Thes. 1:3-7)

B. Evidence #1: The fact that they had patience or perseverance when persecuted is proof that God’s good leadership provided them with grace or supernatural ability to endure with faith and love.

C. Evidence #2: Persecution rightly responded to results in being “counted worthy” or equipped to experience more kingdom activity. “Worthy” doesn’t mean “deserving of,” but “suited for,” or “prepared for.” Persecution purifies us by leading us to align more with God’s leadership. Persecution is an effective “accelerant” to maturing in godliness which in turn increases our spiritual capacity to enjoy God and experience more kingdom activity in our lives.

>35Some of those of understanding shall fall [martyred], to refine and purify them… (Dan. 11:35)

D. Evidence #3: God’s wisdom in repaying with tribulation those who persecute His people becomes evident as their evil deeds and love of darkness are manifest (Jn. 3:19).

E. Evidence #4: God gives them ultimate rest when they receive “all the good pleasure of His goodness” (2 Thes. 1:11) in the age to come related to their spiritual maturity resulting from persecution. Thus it helps us grow unto being worthy (prepared) to receive the fullness of our calling.

>6…it is a righteous thing with God…7to give you rest…when the Lord Jesus is revealed… 11We pray always for you that God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness…12that…Christ be glorified in you, and you in Him… (2 Thes. 1:6-12)

F. Oh, to be counted worthy of a full reward (2 Jn. 8) on Judgment Day without any loss (1 Cor. 3:15)!

>14If anyone’s work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a reward. 15If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. (1 Cor. 3:14-15)

>8…that we do not lose those things we worked for, but that we may receive a full reward. (2 Jn. 8)

G. Paul wrote of his passion to obtain a heavenly crown around AD 54 (1 Cor. 9:24-27). He was zealous not to be disqualified from receiving “the prize” or an imperishable crown (9:25).

>24…[I run to] receive the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain… 25an imperishable crown… 27I discipline my body…lest…I myself should become disqualified. (1 Cor. 9:24-27)

>11[Jesus said]…“Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.” (Rev. 3:11)

H. Near the end of Paul’s life, he pressed for the prize of the upward or heavenly call (Phil. 3:14). He wrote this around AD 62 or 8 years after he wrote of “running to win the prize” (1 Cor. 9:24).

>12Not that I have already attained…I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me [fullness of his calling]… 14I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call [the fullness of his heavenly calling] of God in Christ Jesus. (Phil. 3:12-14)

I. He lived for 6 more years, dying in AD 68 “with assurance” of obtaining a crown (2 Tim. 4:8).

>7I have finished the race…8there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness. (2 Tim. 4:7-8)

J. Peter declared that the maturing of our faith through persecution is more precious than gold.

>6…by various trials, 7that the genuineness [maturity] of your faith, being much more precious than gold…may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus… (1 Pet. 1:6-7)

K. Paul understood the benefits of persecution and longed to know the fellowship of suffering.

>10That I may know Him and [His] power…and the fellowship of His sufferings… (Phil. 3:10)
