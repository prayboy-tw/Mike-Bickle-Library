# Session #7 Worldwide Counterfeit Peace and Safety (1 Thes. 5:3)

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. THREE PROPHETIC TIME FRAMES

A. Review: There are 3 prophetic time frames related to the final 7 years of this age (Dan. 9:27; Mt. 24:8; 1 Thes. 5:2-3) are the beginning of birth pains (possibly starting in 1948 or 1967), worldwide counterfeit peace and safety (3½ years), and the Great Tribulation.

B. Jesus identified 25 signs of the times—23 are negative (Mt. 24; Mk. 13; Lk. 21). He highlighted 12 negative trends as the “beginning of birth pains” that will increase throughout the generation that He returns (Mt. 24:4-8; Lk. 21:8-11). He identified 5 negative trends that will increase “after” the beginning of birth pains and escalate during the final 7 years of this age (Mt. 24:9-12). Then He identified 8 signs that will occur in the 3½ years of the Tribulation (Mt. 24:14-28; Lk. 21:20, 24).

## II. WORLDWIDE COUNTERFEIT PEACE AND SAFETY: 2ND PROPHETIC TIME FRAME

A. Paul prophesied a “counterfeit peace and safety” that will end suddenly when the destruction associated with the Great Tribulation begins (1 Thes. 5:3). This counterfeit time of peace will only operate during the first 3½ years of the final 7 years of this age. Israel will enjoy peace at this time.

>2For you yourselves know perfectly that the Day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. 3For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction [Great Tribulation] comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape. (1 Thes. 5:2-3)

B. The counterfeit peace will be the result of the Antichrist negotiating a peace treaty between Israel and the Islamic nations (Dan. 9:27). Initially, the Antichrist will be seen as a man of peace. He will initially be a regional political leader referred to as the “little horn” (Dan. 7:8; 8:9)

>27Then he [Antichrist] shall confirm a covenant [peace treaty] with many [Israel and Islamic nations] for one week [7-year period]; but in the middle of the week [after 3½ years] he shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering [breaking his covenant with Israel]. (Dan. 9:27)

C. Jesus identified 5 negative trends that will increase “after” the beginning of birth pains and continue to escalate during the final 7 years of this age (Mt. 24:9-12). They include the martyrdom of believers (Mt. 24:9), social anarchy as hatred, betrayal, and offense dominate society (Mt. 24:10), false prophets (some will be popular social commentators (Mt. 24:11), abounding lawlessness (Mt. 24:12) and love growing cold due to many having a seared conscience (1 Tim. 4:2).

>8All these are the beginning of sorrows [birth pains, ESV, NIV]. 9“Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake. 10And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. 11Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. 12And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. 13But he who endures to the end shall be saved.” (Mt. 24:9-13)

D. There will be intense resistance against believers during this time (Mt. 24:9-10). There will be unprecedented persecution against believers (Dan. 7:21, 25; 8:24; 11:33-35; 12:7, 10; Mt. 10:21-22, 28; 24:9; Lk. 12:21:16-19; Rev. 6:9-11; 7:9, 14; 9:21; 11:7; 13:7, 15; 16:5-7; 17:6; 18:24; 19:2).

>9They will…kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake. (Mt. 24:9)

## III. HARLOT BABYLON

A. Revelation 17-18 highlights Babylon in two expressions—the harlot religion (Rev. 17) and the economic city (Rev. 18) or “ecclesiastical Babylon” (Rev. 17) and “economic Babylon” (Rev. 18).

B. A worldwide religious network called the Harlot Babylon will be operating during this time. It will be a religion of great toleration, without absolutes (Rev. 17)—it will made up of people from many different religious back grounds as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. The kings of the earth will participate in it giving it legislative power to kill saints who oppose it.

>1“I will show you the judgment of the great harlot… 2with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication.” (Rev. 17:1-2)

C. This apostate ecclesiastical system will not recognize any one system of doctrine as supreme but will harmonize them all in seeking to ensnare the people from each different religious heritage.

1. Syncretism seeks to harmonize all conflicting doctrines with tolerance and open-mindedness.

2. I do not see this as a formal religion institutionalized with a bishop or leader over every city. Rather, I see it as a religious ideology that gives people confidence to cast off their moral restraints and doctrines about being accountable to God, etc.

D. I agree with a popular view that sees Revelation 17-18 describing the fall of Babylon in two stages.

1. The first phase of the fall of Babylon relates to worldwide religious network of toleration called “the great harlot” (17:1, 5). This fall occurs at the beginning of the Tribulation when a coalition of 10 kings burn (17:16) and replace the harlot religion with Antichrist worship.

>16The ten horns [the 10 kings]…will hate the harlot…eat her flesh and burn her with fire. (Rev. 17:16)

2. The second phase of the fall of Babylon relates to a worldwide economic network. This fall occurs at the end of the Tribulation when God directly destroys the great city (18:8).

E. After the beginning of birth pains, during the first half of the final 7 years of this age, the Harlot Babylon systems will cause multitudes to be drunk, or intoxicated, with the blood of the saints who expose her (Rev. 17:6). The Harlot religion will be resisted boldly by the prophetic Church.

>6I saw the woman [Harlot Babylon], drunk with the blood of the saints… (Rev. 17:6)

F. God will establish the optimum environment for His people to walk in love and purity (Rom. 8:28). God uses the least severe means to bring the greatest number of people to the deepest level of love.

>28And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God… (Rom. 8:28)
