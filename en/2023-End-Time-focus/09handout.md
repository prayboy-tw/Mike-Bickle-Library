# Session #9 The Book of Revelation: Jesus as the "Greater Moses"

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. JESUS’ END-TIME BATTLE PLAN FOR THE CHURCH

A. The book of Revelation reveals the beauty of Jesus (Rev. 1:1) and His plan to transition the earth to the age to come as the ‘greater Moses”. The book is called The Revelation of Jesus because it reveals the beauty of His heart, and leadership in preparing the nations for God’s glory. It is secondarily a book about events in God's end time plan; the main theme is the Man behind the plan.

>1The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants—things which must shortly take place. And He sent and signified it by His angel to His servant John. (Rev. 1:1)

B. The main theme in God’s plan in the book of Revelation is Jesus’ return to earth as king to rule all the nations (Rev. 1:7). His “royal procession” back to earth will be seen by every person.

>7Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him. (Rev. 1:7)

C. The most controversial point in my view is found in my belief that the Church will be on earth during the Tribulation in great victory and power. This differs from the pretribulation rapture view that teaches that the Church might be raptured any day and will miss the end-time revival and crisis. Yes, the Bible teaches that the Church will be raptured. The issue is one of timing.

>29“Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. (Mt. 24:29-31)

D. The book of Revelation describes the Church in victory singing the song of Moses and the Lamb.

>2I saw something like a sea of glass…and those who have the victory over the beast [Antichrist]… 3They sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: “Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints! 4Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy. For all nations shall…worship before You, For Your judgments have been manifested.” (Rev. 15:2-4)

>10I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, “Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down. 11And they overcame him [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death. (Rev. 12:10-11)

E. There are 404 verses in the book of Revelation and only 12 verses or 3% are about persecution.

F. Jesus as “the greater Moses” will destroy Antichrist or “the end-time Pharaoh.” The Moses story is being retold on a global level. As Moses participated in prayer under the Lord’s leadership in releasing His judgments on Pharaoh, so the praying Church will participate in prayer under Jesus’ leadership as He releases the Tribulation judgments on the Antichrist. Many of the trumpet (Rev. 8:8-9) and bowl (Rev. 16) judgments are similar to the ten plagues of Egypt (Ex. 7-12)

G. The type of miracles and healings seen in the books of Exodus and Acts will be multiplied and released worldwide through prayer in the Tribulation. The greatest demonstrations of power in history will be released by the praying Church operating in unity under Jesus’ leadership.

>12“The works that I do he will do also and greater works than these he will do.” (Jn. 14:12)

>15As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt, I will show them wonders.
16The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might…17they shall be afraid of the LORD… (Mic. 7:15-17)

>18I will build My Church, and the gates of Hades [authority of hell] shall not prevail against it. 19I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. (Mt. 16:18-19)

H. As the book of Acts describes the power of the Spirit released through the early church, so the book of Revelation describes God's power to be released through the end-time church. I refer to the book of Revelation as the “end-time book of Acts” and a “canonized prayer manual” that informs the Church of various ways in which Jesus will manifest His power in relationship to the prayers of the whole Body of Christ during the Great Tribulation (Rev. 8:1-6).

I. The prayers of all the saints during the Tribulation will release the trumpet judgments (Rev. 8-9).

>1Another angel…was given much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints… 4The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God…5Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire…and threw it to the earth. 6So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. (Rev. 8:1-6)

>7The first angel sounded: And hail and fire…were thrown to the earth. And a third of the trees were burned up… 8The second angel sounded…and a third of the sea became blood… 10Then the third angel sounded…11A third of the waters became wormwood [bitter]… (Rev. 8:7-11)

>3And I will give power to my two witnesses…5fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies…6These have power to shut heaven…and they have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they desire. (Rev. 11:3-6)

J. David prophesied about one generation that will release the judgments written in the Scripture on the nations through worship and prayer. Releasing judgment by prayer is the honor of all saints.

Let the high praises of God be in their mouth…7to execute vengeance on the nations… 9to execute on them the written judgment-- this honor have all His saints. (Ps. 149:6-9)

K. Jesus prophesied of a generation that would release end-time judgment through 24/7 prayer.

>7Shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him…? 8I tell you that He will avenge them speedily…when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith…? (Lk. 18:7-8)
