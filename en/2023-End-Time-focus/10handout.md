# Session #10 The Church in the Book of Revelation

>“The friend of the Bridegroom…rejoices greatly because of the Bridegroom’s voice.” (Jn. 3:29)

## I. AN ARGUMENT FROM SILENCE

A. Some teach that the Church will be raptured before the Tribulation. This teaching is based in part of on the argument that since the term “Church” is not mentioned after Revelation 4, the Church must no longer be on earth at that time. This is an assumption that is based on silence rather than what the Scripture directly says. There is much evidence in the book of Revelation that the saints will be living and functioning on earth during the Great Tribulation.

B. The great harvest of souls from all nations occurs during the Tribulation. The Church will not be absent at the time of her greatest increase and effectiveness in world evangelism.

>9Behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne...14These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. (Rev. 7:9, 14)

C. Jesus taught that the rapture (Mt. 24:31) will occur immediately after the Tribulation (Mt. 24:29).

>29Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light… 30Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth…will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds…31He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from…one end of heaven to the other. (Mt. 24:29-31)

D. The saints will overcome Satan and the Antichrist with great victory during the Tribulation.

>10I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, “Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down. 11And they overcame him [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony… (Rev. 12:10-11)

E. Some of the saints will be martyred during the Tribulation. Therefore, the Church must be on earth for the saints to be killed during that time.

>6They…they have shed the blood of saints and prophets. (Rev. 16:6)

>6I saw the woman [Harlot Babylon], drunk with the blood of the saints … (Rev. 17:6)

>24In [Babylon] was found the blood of prophets and saints. (Rev. 18:24)

>2He has avenged on [Babylon] the blood of His servants shed by her. (Rev. 19:2)

>10They cried… “How long…until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” 11…it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both the number of their fellow servants and brethren…be killed as they were, was completed. (Rev. 6:10-11)

>4I saw…those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus…who had not worshiped the beast [the Antichrist]. (Rev. 20:4)

F. The saints must be on earth during the Tribulation for the Antichrist to war against them.

>7It was granted to him [Antichrist] to make war with the saints. (Rev. 13:7)

>17The dragon [Satan] was enraged with the woman [remnant of Israel], and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (Rev. 12:17)

G. The prayers of the saints during the Tribulation will release the trumpet judgments. The prayers of ”all” the saints include both the accumulated prayers through history as well as the accelerated prayers in the generation the Lord returns.

>3Another angel…was given much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints... 4The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel’s hand. Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire…and threw it to the earth. (Rev. 8:3-5)

H. Jesus will return in answer to the prayer of the saints on the earth crying out for His return.

>17The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come!” (Rev. 22:17)

I. Prophetic ministry will increase greatly in the saints who will be on earth during the Tribulation (Dan. 11:33-35; 12:10; Joel 2:28-32; Acts 2:17-21; Eph. 4:13; Rev. 11:3-6, 10, 18; 16:6; 18:20, 24; 22:6-9). The seven thunders prophecies were sealed in John’s generation (Rev. 10:4). The clear implication here is that God will release them during the Tribulation to the end-time prophets. The two witnesses or prophets will be born-again believers.

>3I will give power to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy [1,260 days]…. (Rev. 11:3)

J. Calculating the number of the Antichrist will be relevant to those living in the Tribulation who study the Scripture and believe it. In other words, this is written for the aid of believers.

>18Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666. (Rev. 13:18)

K. God’s people are commanded to leave Babylon just prior to her final judgment in Revelation 18.

>4I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, My people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues.” (Rev. 18:4)

L. Only those on earth during the events described in the book of Revelation will be in a position to “keep the prophecy” to the full degree. Keeping the prophecy in its full sense means to participate with Jesus in the unfolding of the holy drama described in the prophecy itself.

>7Behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book. (Rev. 22:7)

M. An angel revealed to Daniel that the saints would be purified in Tribulation described in Daniel 12.

>10Many shall be purified, made white, and refined, but the wicked shall do wickedly. (Dan. 12:10)
